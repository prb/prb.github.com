<p>I've pruned the number of categories down to four &#8212; business, personal, software, and technology.  My interpretation of things like categories is that if you can avoid content (e.g., the Personal category) that you don't have an interest in.</p>

<p>Typo allows the categories to be subscribed to individually, and I have FeedBurner feeds for each of them.  The feeds here will shortly be 302'd to the FeedBurner versions (to keep traffic off of this server), but here's the URL format:</p>

<blockquote><code>http://mult.ifario.us/xml/atom/category/[CATEGORY]/feed.xml</code></blockquote>

<p>I'm also now tagging all of my posts within Typo, and individual tags can be subscribed to as well.  For example, you could subscribe only to posts about BPEL or about Erlang or about entrepreneurship.  I won't be creating FeedBurner equivalents for the tag feeds; here's the URL format:</p>

<blockquote><code>http://mult.ifario.us/xml/atom/tag/[TAG]/feed.xml</code></blockquote>

<p>There is presently no way to subscribe to multiple tags or multiple categories or a combination of both, but you could always build a frankenfeed with something like <a href="http://www.suprglu.com/">Suprglu</a>.</p>
