<p>Testing is great, but instrumentation is both critically important
and often ignored.  After all, failures always come from untested
scenarios.</p>

<p>Basic instrumentation (like heap data) is good, but basic
instrumentation is also a bit like taking a picture of a race car.
Other than from context, it's impossible to know whether it's going
200MPH or just parked in the middle of the racetrack.  For example,
the average velocity of a response time parameter indicates whether
response times are getting longer or shorter or staying about the
same, and the average rate of change of the average rate of change
indicates whether a linear extrapolation is likely to miss high or
low.</p>

<p>Here's a simple approach to get thumbnail rates of change for a
stream of values; I'll explain how to integrate it with JMX a little
later.  The first ingredient is a useful little utility class that
computes the moving average of a stream of <code>long</code> values.
(Clearly the values can't be that large, ideally no larger than
<code>MAX_LONG/2*size</code>.)</p>

<pre class="code">public class CircularWindow {
  private long sum;
  private long last;
  private long[] x;
  private int ptr;
  private int size;
  private boolean full;

  public CircularWindow(int size) {
    x = new long[size];
    this.size = size;
  }

  public void add(long y) {
    sum += (last = y) - x[ptr];
    x[ptr] = y;
    if (++ptr == size) {
      ptr = 0;
      full = true;
    }
  }

  public long average() {
    return full?(sum/size):((ptr!=0)?(sum/ptr):sum);
  }

  public long last() {
    return last;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>It is built with the assumption that the average will be requested
frequently but not necessarily every time a value is added.  (If the
average was requested infrequently versus the size of the buffer, it
would make more sense to compute the sum only when the average was
requested.)</p>

<p>To get at rates of change, chain up two of the windows and add
values like so:</p>

<pre class="code">D_s.add(value - s.last());
s.add(value);</pre>

<p>Now, what does this do?  For a hint, try this:</p>

<pre class="code">CircularWindow x = new CircularWindow(100);
CircularWindow y = new CircularWindow(100);
CircularWindow z = new CircularWindow(100);
for (long i=0; i &lt; 50000; ++i) {
  long value = i*i;
  z.add(value - y.last() - x.last());
  y.add(value- x.last());
  x.add(value);
  if (i > 49990) {
    System.out.println("x av = " + x.average());
    System.out.println("y av = " + y.average());
    System.out.println("z av = " + z.average());
  }
}</pre>

<p>The series <code>y</code> ticks up two every time, and the <code>z</code> series is constant 2.  It looks like the cleverly-named <code>D_s</code> series from above approximates the first derivative of the <code>s</code> series, and presuming that the values in the series come from a suitable well-behaved differentiable function, that's obvious if you write it out:</p>

<p align="center">D_s(n+1) ~ (s(n+1) - s(n))/((n+1) - n) = s(n+1) - s(n)</p>

<p>The main window and the second window for tracking the rate of
change can be encapsulated conveniently:</p>

<pre class="code">public class VelocityWindow {
  private CircularWindow s;
  private CircularWindow D_s;

  public VelocityWindow(int size) {
    s = new CircularWindow(size);
    D_s = new CircularWindow(size);
  }

  public void add(long x) {
    D_s.add(x - s.last());
    s.add(x);
  }

  public long average() {
    return s.average();
  }

  public long velocity() {
    return D_s.average();
  }

  public long ticksToClear() {
    if (D_s.average >= 0) return -1;
    return s.last() / D_s.average();
  }
}</pre>

<p>The fully reusable path for integration into an application's JMX
instrumentation is via a <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/javax/management/monitor/MonitorMBean.html"><code>MonitorMBean</code></a>
implementation.  A <code>MonitorMBean</code> typically uses a timer
(e.g., a <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/TimerTask.html"><code>TimerTask</code></a>)
to sample an attribute and then either exposes attributes or fires
notifications.  (The <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/1.4/docs/api/javax/management/monitor/GaugeMonitor.html"><code>GaugeMonitor</code></a>
is similar in flavor but not really the same thing.)</p>

<p>I haven't ever gotten around to taking the
<code>MonitorMBean</code> approach, since the quick and dirty path is
simply to embed the <code>VelocityWindow</code> directly in the MBean
and expose <code>average</code> and <code>velocity</code> as
attributes.  Another derived metric that is useful when tracking
backlogs is ticks to clear, which would either be infinite if
<code>D_s.average()</code> is non-negative or
<code>-1*s.last()/D_s.average()</code> otherwise.</p>
