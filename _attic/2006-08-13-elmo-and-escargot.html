<p>Kids absorb and imitate.  Two recent events reminded me about just how well they absorb and how strong the desire to imitate can be.</p>

<p>Television is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">lead plumbing</a> of our age, and we give the kid only small doses.  She'll get more than enough of it through friends and relatives anyway.  Only PBS/Sprout, only shows with slow-paced visuals.  She's seen a couple episodes of Sesame Street, at most.  Nonetheless, she knows who <a href="http://www.sesameworkshop.org/sesamestreet/elmosworld/">Elmo</a> is.  A couple of weeks ago at <a href="http://www.fredmeyer.com/">Freddy's</a>, she selected an Elmo-branded baby toothbrush for herself.  It went back on the rack; we bought her an unbranded one.  Then, at <a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/">Whole Foods</a>, she spontaneously snagged some Elmo-branded oatmeal off the shelf.  That went back on the shelf, too, since oats have never been her favorite, and I'd rather give her the <a href="http://www.mccanns.ie/">good stuff</a>.</p>

<p>We took the kid out to a reasonably nice restaurant recently, ordered escargot as an appetizer and gave her a few slices to try.  Since she was about six months old and would lunge for food on the table, she's wanted to at least try anything that we're eating, and usually she likes it.  We manage to keep the things from her that she shouldn't have (unpasteurized cheeses, less than fully cooked eggs, etc.), but once she catches you eating something, she wants to try it.  It's very likely that she'll remember the appearance or packaging and try to sneak up to the table, climb onto a chair, and snag some while the table is being set.  She has also started insisting on having the same utensils that we have for a meal.  This doesn't work out well for chopsticks, but it works OK for forks.  Her version of using a fork is to spear something with the fork and then take it off with her hand and pop it in her mouth.  (She does does know how to use a fork properly.)</p>
