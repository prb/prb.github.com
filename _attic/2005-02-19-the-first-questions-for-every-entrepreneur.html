<p>I happened across <a href="http://www.userscape.com/blog">Ian Landsman</a>'s <a href="http://www.userscape.com/blog/2005/02/15/starting-a-micro-isv-in-the-beginning-there-was-nothing/">post</a> about starting a <a href="http://www.microisv.com/">micro ISV</a>, and I was disappointed to find one piece of advice missing.  In fact, these questions are missing from most advice for entrepreneurs, even though the answers are fundamental to eveything that follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>What do you want to be &#8212; famous, comfortable, rich, or wealthy?</li>
<li>What do you want your company to be?</li>
<li>What do you want to be in the company &#8212; CEO, CTO, crazy scientist with a corner office, or a janitor with a lot of options?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you align your plans with your goals, then you have a shot at both success and some reasonable amount of happiness.  If you do not, then you have a great shot at having neither.</p>
