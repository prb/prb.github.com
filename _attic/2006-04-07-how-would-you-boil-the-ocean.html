<p>Via <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mikechampion/">Mike Champion</a>, I've come to find out that there's a whole book full of think-outside-the-box interview questions called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316778494">How Would You Move Mount Fuji?</a>.</p>

<p>Here's one of my favorite such:</p>

<blockquote>An infinite number of identical ball bearings are at rest and spaced out on an infinite, perfectly level frictionless surface.  A single ball bearing, identical to the others, is rolled down a ramp onto the surface, and the ramp is removed.  After some amount of time has elapsed, and without watching in the interim, how can you identify the ball bearing that was added?</blockquote>

<p>After a little while, I'll put an answer in the comments.</p>
