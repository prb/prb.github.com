<p>It <a href="http://community.java.net/jdk/opensource/">looks</a>
like SUN's serious about open sourcing Java, where Java means the JDK.
Among the various languages that I use, I could count the number of
times that I've looked at the source code for Ruby, Python, Perl, GCC,
GCL, and GHC on the fingers of an absent-minded stonemason, and almost
all of those times have been when I wanted to compile something
bleeding edge on an obscure operating system.  Diving into a highly
complex codebase and making positive changes simply isn't done.  The
SUN JVMs are already open enough for my taste.  The <a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jvmti/index.html">JVMTI</a>
is available as a plug-in point, and the source code for the Java
standard libraries is available.</p>

<p>Will "open source Java" prevent cruft from getting into the
standard libraries for Java or evict some of the current dross and
detritus?  Will it save us from the next EJB or Crimson?  Strip the
Java standard libraries down to a minimal subset of what they
currently contain, don't put it back, provide a great package manager,
and that's open enough for me.</p>
