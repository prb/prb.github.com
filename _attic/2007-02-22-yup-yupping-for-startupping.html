<p>Several people have pointed to <a href="http://www.startupping.com/">Startupping</a> as a new resource for entrepreneurs, and I've signed up and subscribed to the <a href="http://www.startupping.com/html/blogs.php">feeds</a>.  It looks to have plenty of traction (in the form of content, participation, and buzz), and I'll throw in my $0.02 where it makes sense.</p>
