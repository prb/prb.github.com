<p>I was actually excited to see <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/">iLife '08</a> come out because of one small feature in <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie</a>:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://blog.prb.io/files/ilife08.png" /></p>

<p>I took "AVCHD support" to mean that HD footage from my camcorder (Sony HDR-SR1) was finally supported, but trying to import AVCHD video in iMovie on my G5 pops up an error dialog:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://blog.prb.io/files/ilife08-nog5.png" /></p>

<p>The fine print isn't linked from the iMovie product page or from the iMovie applicaction help, but there is a camcorder support <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306171">document</a> that links to a knowledgebase <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305919">article</a> that explains that AVCHD support is <em>Intel only</em> for the HDR-SR1.  (Oddly, other cameras appear to have no problems with AVCHD import on the G5?)</p>

<p>That little issue might be worth an asterisk on the feature list.</p>
