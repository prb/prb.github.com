<p><a href="http://weblog.itredux.com">Ismael</a> pinged me today with an <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/200602.mbox/raw/%3c52b3da2a0602151407k2edc93a7q12bbd5053477bd8e@mail.gmail.com%3e">email</a> that he sent to the Apache Incubator <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/">list</a>:</p>

<blockquote>[...] Our company [Intalio] would be interested in participating to the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/incubator/OdeProposal">Ode</a> project through a donation of the PXE BPEL 2.0 engine and the dedication of development resources to the project. [...]</blockquote>

<p>There is already the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/agila/">Agila BPM</a> project under incubation, and there was recently the <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=geronimo-dev&amp;m=113889737913976&amp;w=2">contribution</a> of a BPEL4WS&#160;1.1 implementation by Sybase.   It's my opinion that adding <a href="http://pxe.intalio.org">PXE</a> to the mix should actually help clear things up and shorten the time to market for the combined effort &#8212; PXE is a complete implementation of the WS-BPEL 2.0 standard with a great team behind it, and it will round out the set of ideas and concepts that the Twister/Agila and Sybase codebases embody.  Bill Flood, who represents Sybase on the OASIS BPEL committee, put it in perspective <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-general/200602.mbox/raw/%3cde9130c00602151516p5a6c0496ja5fa288dfda0f14b@mail.gmail.com%3e">succinctly</a>:</p>

<blockquote>It's all good news for the community at large!</blockquote>
