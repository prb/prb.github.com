<p>The <a href="http://fremontartscouncil.org/events_solstice.html">2007 Fremont Solstice Parade</a> happened yesterday, and while it wasn't as creative as last year's (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/p-r-b/sets/72157600384897814/">photo set</a>), it was still interesting to see what the community came up with.  The combination puppet and costume in the middle below was my favorite, but the photo doesn't really do justice to how natural the motions of the puppets were.  The real disappointment this year was with the hooting and hollering from the crowd, where that kind of meathead behavior hadn't been as apparent the previous year in spite of an equal number of naked or effectively naked people parading around.</p>

<p>Here's a link to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/p-r-b/sets/72157600384637086/">2007 set</a>.  The shots are cross-posted in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/fremontseattle/pool/">three</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/freemontsolsticeparade/pool/">photo</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/fremontsolstice/pool/">pools</a>, but don't bother if you've got issues with nudity or liberal politics. (Here's a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/yelley/sets/72157600377968526/">set</a> with some good shots of the cyclists getting painted before their ride.)</p>

<p>As taking pictures goes, I took my <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond200/">D200</a> instead of the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/0202/02022405leicadigilux1.asp">Leica Digilux 1</a> that I was using last year, and I continue to be infinitely happier with the DSLR than the point-and-shoot.  The D200 has been particularly nice for the minimal power-up time and the ergonomics of the controls; I can dial-in a different ISO setting, bracket five shots across +/-2 stops, and squeeze off a pile of frames in a second, all without taking one hand off the kid sitting on my shoulders.  (The "prosumer" features double as dad-friendly features...)  While the Leica took good pictures and was my first digital camera, my previous camera was venerable a (non-digital) <a href="http://www.rokkorfiles.com/XD11.html">Minolta XD-11</a> that I'd inherited from a relative back in the early 1990s, and no amount of digital convenience could make me forget the level of control provided by the the SLR.</p>
