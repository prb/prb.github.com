<p>With FiveSight's users almost entirely switched to non-Microsoft operating systems (namely, Mac OS X and debian Linux), it's an opportunity to ditch Microsfot Word entirely.  (As <a href="http://blogs.fivesight.com/pbblog/index.php?p=34">little</a> as I like Word, I like even less the use of <code>.doc</code> as the standard interchange format for business.)  Using L<sub>A</sub>T<sub>E</sub>X for documentation makes good sense, since the output via <a href="http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex">PDFL<sub>A</sub>T<sub>E</sub>X</a> is beautiful and portable.  Moreover, both L<sub>A</sub>T<sub>E</sub>X and tools to edit it (i.e., Emacs with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/">AUCT<sub>E</sub>X</a>) are generally available.  Product documentation, Board minutes, and corporate letterhead were the first to go, and now contracts and other legal documents are following.</p>

<p>One of the challenges was signature blocks for contracts, but L<sub>A</sub>T<sub>E</sub>X's <code>tabular*</code> environment makes it easy:</p>

<pre class="code">\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}% =396pt in this case
{@{} \p{180pt} @{} \p{36pt} @{} \p{180pt} @{}}
&amp; &amp; \

\end{tabular*}</pre>

<p>At least in my book, that beats mousing around for 15 minutes...</p>
