<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/">John Evdemon</a> (one of the OASIS WS-BPEL <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsbpel">TC</a> co-chairs) <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2004/12/15/316213.aspx">posted</a> a pointer to an informal survey on <a href="http://www.webservicespipeline.com/">Web Services Pipeline</a>.  When he posted around two weeks ago, the "What's BPEL?" percentage was an even 50%, and even now, it's only down to 40% with 28% of the respondents saying that they <em>have</em> a BPEL implementation in-house and <em>23%</em> planning to implement.  A little more information about the sample would be interesting, e.g., which BPEL products (FiveSight, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, ActiveBPEL, Twister, etc.), which BPEL versions (1.0, 1.1, pre-2.0), how many processes, what size and type of organization, etc., but it's still an interesting thermometer.</p>

<p>If you're looking for information about BPEL, take John's advice and go straight to the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=wsbpel">source</a>.  If you're looking for vendors, you can find a list of the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/membership.php?wg_abbrev=wsbpel">people</a> who've been shaping and refining the specification.  "Prospective member" means that they're relatively new; "member" means that they've been around for a while, and the 33 founding members are listed in the <a href="http://xml.coverpages.org/WSBPEL-CFP.html#proposal">proposal</a>.</p>
