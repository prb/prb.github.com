<p>I woke up this morning with my right hand stiff, sore, and roughly claw-shaped, but it took me a minute to groggily recall the cause.  We drove up from visiting family in Portland (i.e., the one in Oregon) yesterday, and the drive was about as bad as it could have been: almost six hours straight of either crawling through congestion in Tacoma or blearily staring at the tail lights of other cars through driving rain.  I tend to tighten my grip on the wheel if we hit standing water, and that was pretty much the whole trip.  Maybe we'll take the train next time...</p>
