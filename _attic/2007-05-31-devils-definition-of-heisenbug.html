<p>Another entry for my personal <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/972">Devil's Dictionary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><b>heisenbug</b>, <em>n.</em>  A error in a software system that can only be observed in the absence of detailed logging and/or a debugger.</blockquote>
<p>For what it's worth, there are situations where heisenbugs do exist, e.g., <code>toString()</code> implementations with side-effects that are called in logging statements and other such pathological silliness.</p>
