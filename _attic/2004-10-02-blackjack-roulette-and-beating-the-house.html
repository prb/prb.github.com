<p>Although I don't get much chance to read, I've started a new non-fiction book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743249992/pbblog-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1">Bringing Down the House</a>, about a group of MIT grad students who used refined card-counting techniques to beat the odds in blackjack.</p>

<p>If memory serves, the classic card counting techniques provide a about a 1% advantage over the house.  That is, there is an asymptotic 1% advantage assuming an infinite bank; a simulation shows that actually realizing that advantage requires a substantial bank and patience -- something like 100 times the bet as a bank to reduce the chance of going bankrupt to 1%.  A fancier heuristic can make a big difference, however.  When I was a graduate student and had an opportunity to get over to Reno from Berkeley, I experimented with a four-slot card sorting technique that used both the weighted sum of the different category counts and the shape of the histogram ("buck-toothed" or "gap-toothed" shapes added additional information) to make decisions.  I never had the time to run a real simulation, but the heuristic worked relatively well in practice even if I occasionally made stupid moves (intentionally, of course) to make it look like I was just being lucky.  At any rate, coming up with a heuristic that provides useful information in practice (multi-deck shoe, different seating positions at the table, etc.) is an interesting challenge.</p>

<p>Another interesting read on the subject of beating the house is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0595142362/pbblog-20?creative=327641&amp;camp=14573&amp;link_code=as1">The Eudaemonic Pie</a> by <a href="http://www.thomasbass.com/work2.htm">Thomas Bass</a>, about a group that built tiny toe-controlled, radio-linked computers into their shoes to solve the dynamics of roulette on the fly.  (The book was out of print (but <a href="http://www.abebooks.com">available</a> if you knew where to look), but it looks like it's been reprinted.)  While their efforts with roulette didn't pay off directly, the team later <a href="http://www.thomasbass.com/work7.htm">applied</a> their ideas to building models for trading derivatives.</p>
