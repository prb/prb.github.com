<p><a href="http://asack.typepad.com/">Andy Sack</a> (of <a href="http://www.judysbook.com/">Judy's List</a>) is hosting a weekly <a href="http://opencoffee.ning.com/profile/asackofseattle">open forum</a> for entrepreneurs, and I stopped by the first meeting this morning.  I came late and talked with a few  folks, but it seems like a good mix of people at different stages of their careers and businesses.  It was a welcome dose of nostalgia &#8212; back in 1999-2000 when FiveSight was just raising an angel round and rolling-up its first customers, I was a regular attendee at monthly founder-only networking dinners (usually at <a href="http://www.rezasrestaurant.com/">Reza's</a> downtown) hosted by Paul Doyle (of <a href="http://www.proofspace.com/">ProofSpace</a>, then and now).  The Chicago dinners scaled up to about 70 people at the peak but ended when the bubble burst and implosion of Divine Interventures dragged-down most of the companies.</p>

<p>I don't know that I'll go weekly, but I'll attend regularly.</p>
