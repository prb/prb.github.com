<p>After a mishap with a window at home, I have a broken #3 finger on my right hand. The adolescent novelty of a splint on my middle finger wore off almost immediately, and I'm left to figure out how to be productive without the use of that finger for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>On the one hand [sic.], years of piano and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0793525446/qid=1052753325/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-1885687-6369730?tag=pbblog-20&amp;v=glance&amp;s=books">finger execises</a> have made it relatively easy for me to adjust, but I'm concerned about heavy usage of my fourth and fifth fingers because the splint interferes with good hand position.  I'm already starting to get some sense of strain.  (Oddly enough, the <a href="http://www.musicandhealth.co.uk/ergonomics.htm">fingers</a> are not <a href="http://www.musicandhealth.co.uk/tension.html">fully independent</a>; <a href="">Schumann</a> discovered this the hard way.  One way or another, I'm still much better off than another <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wittgenstein">Paul</a>.)</p>

<p>There are some interesting <a href="http://www.infogrip.com/category_view.asp?subcategory=1&amp;CatTxt=One+Handed&amp;option=keyboard">one-handed keyboards</a> (thanks to <a href="http://www.crazybob.org">Bob Lee</a> for the initial pointer), and there is voice recognition. I'll probably give the one-handed keyboard a try, because voice recognition isn't going to cut it for entering Java, XML, or anything other than narrative text. If anyone has some other suggestions, they would be welcome.</p>
