<p>It turns out that the temperature <a href="http://blog.prb.io/a-dirty-g5-is-a-sleepy-g5.html">issues</a> with my G5 were not merely due to a little accumulated dust.&#160; The temperature sensor on CPU B has gone downhill to the point where it puts the machine to sleep after about 10 minutes from a cold boot, whether the machine is just idling or working hard, and then it's another couple of hours before its cool enough to boot again.&#160; The interesting thing to me is that this isn't an isolated issue, see, for example, this <a href="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/G5/quad_G5_cpu_temperatures.html">post</a> and this <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=419032">thread</a>.&#160; In fact, Apple changed the <a href="http://www.xlr8yourmac.com/archives/mar06/032406.html">cooling design</a> after my machine was shipped.</p>

<p><img align="right" src="http://blog.prb.io/images/coyote_genius.png" style="margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px;" />I had a "Genius" at the Apple Store and a local non-Apple <a href="http://www.thecomputerstore.com/">repair shop</a> take separate looks at the machine, and the diagnosis was the same &#38;mdash; unknown root cause, but the standard course of action is to successively replace the <a href="http://www.mac-pro.com/Powermac-G5-Dual-Core-Logic-Board-Late-2005_2?sc=2&#38;category=454">logic board</a> and one or both <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/thunderaudio/PhotoAlbum11.html">CPUs</a> to see if that helps.&#160; (I didn't ask the "Genius" to show me his <a href="http://www.mensa.org/">Mensa</a> card...)&#160; The part shuffle isn't a surefire fix: it may help, but it may just cost money and not help at all.&#160; The person-to-person street value for an equivalently configured machine, <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/__Apple-Desktops?ProcessorType10457e48=PowerPCG5902f7c56&amp;ProductFamily72d913f5=PowerMac3706ae2a&amp;_fxd=1&amp;_ver=4&amp;ProcessorSpeedf857f2f9=25GHzormored33439e4&amp;ProcessorConfiguration7f8595a8=Quad269567">via eBay</a>, is about $1,800, which is barely more than the total cost of parts and labor if both the logic board and one CPU are needed.&#160; The machine is nice and heavy, so maybe it will make a good boat anchor...</p>

<p>For what it's worth, my experience at the Genius Bar was similar to <a href="http://feeds.gawker.com/~r/valleywag/full/~3/188487683/whos-the-genius-who-runs-apple-repair-325593.php">Paul Boutin's</a>.&#160; A twenty-something woman with various metal bits in her lips and nose asked me what the G5 was and if I did "computer stuff".&#160; I contemplated making up a story about how it was a really big iPod with a special headphone amplifier and personal subwoofer built-in, but I just replied "yes" and left it at that.&#160; The local repair shop provided more information but took two weeks to do it.&#160; Maybe people who use their Apple products to make money instead of spend it are no longer the company's core market?&#160; His house is a lot bigger than mine, so I can hardly fault Real Steve Jobs for his choices.</p>

<p>Today, I spent nearly two hours on the phone with Apple support, working my way through offshore call centers to someone with actual knowledge of the machine, but the response was a resounding "You should have bought <a href="http://www.apple.com/support/products/proplan.html">AppleCare</a>."&#160; I have a hard time trusting someone who can look me in the eye and tell me that I need to put money down on a bet that their product will fail, but that's the official line.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.labnotes.org/">Assaf</a> put his <a href="http://twitter.com/assaf">Twitter</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/assaf/statuses/433274482">finger</a> on one of my thoughts: <em>maybe Apple is not the answer.</em></p>

<p>And maybe it is time to give Linux another shot as a primary operating system.&#160; The <a href="http://www.aslab.com/">company</a> that I bought reliable workstations from back when I was an academic is still in business...&#160; Apple is far from perfect, but up to now, they have been better enough to win my business.&#160; Like <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/11/21/Leopard-Ouch">other</a> <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/11/16/caught-in-apple-restart-hell/">people</a>, I have had issues with Apple operating system updates on my laptops (<a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper</a> is well worth the money!), and I've had to install from scratch at least a half-dozen times in the past five years.&#160; In fact, I've developed a ritual for migrating my settings and additional binaries (primarily <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>) to a new install.&#160; Nonetheless, it would be hard to leave the Mac behind.&#160; I use and love <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a>, <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">VoodooPad</a>, <a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/quicksilver/what_is_quicksilver">QuickSilver</a>, <a href="http://hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper">TaskPaper</a>, and a host of other Mac-only software, including more spendy stuff like <a href="http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?reaktor_us">Reaktor</a>.</p>

<p>If the guts are sufficiently generic, I'll give the <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2007/11/07/first-intel-penryn-based-pcs-arrive-apple-to-follow/">forthcoming</a> <a href="http://blogs.intel.com/technology/2007/04/penryn.html">Penryn</a> machines a chance, and if not, I'll take my money elsewhere.</p>
