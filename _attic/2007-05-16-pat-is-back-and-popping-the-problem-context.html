<p>The prospect of spending time with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/">Pat</a> was one of the main reasons that I took a position at Amazon long ago, although we both migrated to roles in different parts of the company a relatively short time after I joined, so it's nice to see Pat <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/05/14/i-m-glad-to-be-back.aspx">out of the jungle</a> and blogging.  (My office was close enough to Pat's that I could drop by conveniently but far enough away that I couldn't smell the puns...)</p>

<p>Pat's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/pathelland/archive/2007/05/15/memories-guesses-and-apologies.aspx">entry</a> on his talk from CIDR (<a href="http://www-db.cs.wisc.edu/cidr/cidr2007/papers/cidr07p15.pdf">paper</a>) contains one of the lessons of running a business: <em>The customer is the observer who matters.</em>  (I mentioned <a href="http:/blog.prb.io/doneness-and-the-boundary-between-development-and-operations.html">something</a> about this topic in the context of "doneness" and business tradeoffs once upon a time.)  It's important to regularly and religiously pop the problem solving context until the customer's problem is what you're thinking about, since that's ultimately why you'll get paid.</p>
