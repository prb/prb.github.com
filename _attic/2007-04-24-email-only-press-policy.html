<p>I've never been correctly quoted by the press, and on the off chance that it could have been my fault, I don't bear any grudges over it.  (I take that back &#8212; I have a bone to pick with the person who quoted me as saying something about "leaving out 20%" instead of talking about hitting the "80% solution".)  Contrary to conventional wisdom (which is often wrong), not all press is good press, and press that clouds or confuses your message is <em>bad</em> press.</p>

<p>Jason Calcanis has the <a href="http://www.calacanis.com/2007/04/24/wired-journo-wont-do-email-interviews-ironic/">right idea</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Journalists have been burning subjects for so long with paraphrased quotes, half quotes, and misquotes that I think a lot of folks (especially ones who don't need the press) are taking an email only interview policy. (Mark Cuban did this long ago)</blockquote>

<p>Unless the interviewer intends to mislead or spring questions on the interviewee, I can't imagine why an email-only policy would be objectionable.</p>
