<p>Matthieu <a href="http://mriou.wordpress.com/2006/12/13/trivia-tag/">tagged</a> me, so here are five things that you probably didn't know:</p>

<ul>
<li>I spent the first few years of my life living out in the sticks in southwest Washington where we had a half-mile gravel driveway and a quarter-acre vegetable garden.  We moved to the city after a huge fir tree smashed the mobile home we were living in.</li>
<li>I've been in two bands in my life, a one funk-ish band (1989) that made an EP in a dinky studio in Milwaukee, OR, and a rap band (1990) called "MC Extra Cheese and DJ PRB", where I was the sampler and mixer master.</li>
<li>I don't need much sleep, although I seem to feel better if I sleep either more than seven hours or less than four and get a ten minute nap in the afternoon in either case.</li>
<li>My first Java program was a 3,000-line hand-written parser that turned a narrative document in the file format of an ancient version of WordPerfect for DOS into XML.  It worked great...</li>
<li>I have always been slower multiplying either 6&times;9 or 7&times;8 than other combinations of digits.</li>
</ul>

<p>And because I can, I'll tag <a href="http://www.fnokd.com/">Bob McWhirter</a>, <a href="http://www.netzooid.com">Dan</a>, <a href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/">Brian</a>, <a href="http://crazybob.org">Crazy Bob</a>, and <a href="http://schneider.blogspot.com/">Jeff</a>.</p>
