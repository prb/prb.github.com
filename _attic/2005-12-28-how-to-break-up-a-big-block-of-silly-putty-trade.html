<p>Over on the Google blog, Clay Bavor <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/im-feeling-silly.html">commented</a> about purchasing 250 pounds of Silly Putty&trade; (or perhaps a roughly equivalent but off-brand mixture of silicone oil and boric acid) but having trouble dividing it up once it coalesced into a single mass.</p>

<p>Counterintuitively, one way to get a piece of putty off of a lump is to hit it <em>really</em> hard &#8212; the lump will shatter.  For example, dropping the 250-pound blob of putty from the clock tower on the Stanford quad (ideally without hitting anyone) would probably have worked.  At least as far as I know, this is because the putty is a dilatant non-Newtonian fluid, i.e., viscosity increases with shear force.  (Now that I think about it, using something like a wire cheese slicer but moving it very slowly would also probably have worked well.)  Under stress, the physical properties of a dilatant polymer depend on the properties (brittle, elastic, malleable) of the molecules, but my knowledge ends there.  Based purely on the boron and silicon, would be that the limiting behavior of Silly Putty&trade; is that of a glass, but I honestly don't know.</p>
