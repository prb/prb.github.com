<p><a href="http://www.pyrasun.com/mike/mt/">Mike Spille</a> opened a can of Holiday <a href="http://www.pyrasun.com/mike/mt/archives/2004/12/23/22.37.00/index.html">whup-ass</a> for <a href="http://www.prevayler.org">Prevayler</a>.  (For old-timers, that's pronounced "batch with restart"...)  Given the airing of grievances, maybe Mike is celebrating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivus">Festivus</a>, complete with <a href="http://www.pyrasun.com/mike/mt/archives/2004/12/25/15.02.00/index.html">wrestling</a>...  I have a few grievances of my own, but I haven't had the time to write them up.</p>

<p>Products and projects should have a simple, objective statement of their functionality and target use cases, and lacking that, they deserve scrutiny and scorn, even on Christmas.  This sort of thing needs to happen more often, and it can be -- but seldom is -- accomplished without eviscerating the subject.  (In this case, there was already a Prevayler "<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ThePrevayler">thread</a>" going over on Ward's wiki.)  Hopefully, in the end, discussion and exploration root out the kernel of truth and value for all, and <a href="http://jroller.com/page/cv/20041224#sorry_everybody">sanity</a> reigns.</p>

<p>For open source projects with digestible code bases, it's reasonable for a suitably inclined individual to sit down and make a critique of the architecture and implementation.  But what about more complex projects or commercial products and industry specifications?  It's technically not an industry analyst's job to rain down scorn on deserving software vendors, but with <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=56200450&amp;tid=5979">consolidation</a> running through the IT analysis industry and many analysts deriving a substantial portion of their revenues from vendors, who's out there to keep vendors honest or make meaningful comparisons?  For the vendors, is it better to take the high road or to stoop to the lowest level of marketing among competitors?</p>
