<p>I got a decent score on the <a href="http://electricpulp.com/vcat/">electronic version</a> of the <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/11/the_venture_cap.html">VCAT</a>:</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I've enjoyed the coaching and advising work that I've done with fellow entrepreneurs, and it's satisfying if not therapeutic to help people avoid the pitfalls and pratfalls that I'm more familiar with than I'd like to be.  While a non-empty subset of the people I respect have MBAs (e.g., <a href="http://www.steveshu.typepad.com/">Steve</a>) and I benefited greatly from some of them as experts and advisors, I can't imagine anyone without their CEO stripes really knowing how to build and run a company.</p>
