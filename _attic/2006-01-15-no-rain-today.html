<p>And, after 27 straight days of rain, that's <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/255840_norain16.html">news</a>.  Even so, we're only a couple inches ahead of normal on the weather year (October-October), and I wouldn't have noticed unless folks were keeping track.  (In spite of its reputation, Seattle isn't all that rainy in absolute terms; for example, in terms of total precipitation, it rains about 25% more in <a href="http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/united-states/new-york/new-york-central-park/">New York City</a> and about 7% less in <a href="http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/united-states/illinois/chicago/">Chicago</a>, on average, than <a href="http://www.climate-zone.com/climate/united-states/washington/seattle-co/">Seattle</a>.  It is, however, about 8% more likely to rain on any given day in Seattle than in either New York City or Chicago.  The sum of the &#8220;Heating Degree Days&#8221; and &#8220;Cooling Degree Days&#8221; is the statistic that really speaks to livability, IMHO, and Seattle's 4,778 compares favorably with Chicago's 7,288 and New York City's 5,901.)</p>
