<p>After having my hard drive renamed &#8220;iywemsndfgouy&#8221; a few times, I got a recommendation for <a href="http://www.kldickey.addr.com/alphababy/">AlphaBaby</a> from <a href="http://www.javarants.com/">Sam</a> (thanks!), and the kid likes it.  A lot.  AlphaBaby displays shapes and letters and plays sounds in response to keypresses but otherwise locks the machine down.  (Nonetheless, Emme has managed to hit the magic key combination ctrl-alt-cmd-q a few times with her palm and middle finger and get back to renaming desktop items.)  My old 17&#8220; G4 Powerbook is a downstairs email terminal about 50% of the time and running AlphaBaby for Emme the other 50%.  (Fortunately, she's not talking yet to ask for a MacBook Pro...)  She has a grand time massaging the keyboard and watching the shapes.  She has actually started to peck at the keys with a finger as her manual dexterity improves, but it's never very long before she notices the power button on the upper right &#8212; round, shiny, textured, and inviting.  It just looks like it should be pushed, so it gets pushed.  Repeatedly.  Half the time, she suspends the machine; half the time, she shuts it down.  We'll see how long it takes for her to get over the urge to push it.</p>
