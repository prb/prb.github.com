<p>The kid does this bouncing thing when she hears music that she likes.  (It's kind of like the way an average white guy dances...)  If she's stuck in her high chair or in the car, she bobs her head to the beat to show approval.  She has pretty good  taste.  She dances for the Beatles, for Bach, and for the <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/music/">musical interludes</a> on NPR programs like <a href="http://www.thislife.org/">This American Life</a> or <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/">Marketplace</a>.  She also likes &#8220;<a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/indietronica">indietronica</a>&#8221; (a.k.a. modern minimalist <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/krautrock">Krautrock</a>), which is nice, since I have plenty of it around and can get more DRM-free and on-demand from my favorite on-line music store, <a href="http://www.bleep.com">Bleep</a>.  The kid's picks in the genre include <a href="http://www.boardsofcanada.com/">Boards of Canada</a>, <a href="http://www.bleep.com/search.php?search=Plaid">Plaid</a>, <a href="http://www.bleep.com/search.php?search=Plone">Plone</a>, <a href="http://www.isan.co.uk/">I.S.A.N.</a> (<a href="http://www.bleep.com/current_item.php?selection=ANOST0077_DM">their rendition</a> of some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnop%C3%A9dies">classic</a> Satie is her current go-to-sleep music), <a href="http://www.bfleischmann.com/">b. fleischmann</a>, and pretty much anything on <a href="http://www.morrmusic.com/">Morr</a>.</p>
