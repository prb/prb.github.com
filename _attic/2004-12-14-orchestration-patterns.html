<p><a href="http://micro-workflow.com/">Dragos Manolescu</a>'s orchestration patterns <a href="http://www.orchestrationpatterns.com/">site</a> now has <a href="http://www.orchestrationpatterns.com/OrchestrationPatterns.html">draft content</a> on-line and an <a href="http://www.orchestrationpatterns.com/RSS/index.xml">RSS feed</a>.  Dragos is taking a high-level <a href="http://www.hillside.net">pattern</a>-oriented view of orchestration, including runtime, design-time, management, and philosophical considerations.  Orchestration, as services from services, will pick up speed as a prerequisite for reuse and recombination in service-oriented architecture, so I'm looking forward to seeing this body of work evolve and expand.  (I might even find the time to contribute a pattern or two.)</p>

<p>Note that Dragos's work on orchestration patterns is not to be confused with the work of <a href="http://tmitwww.tm.tue.nl/staff/wvdaalst/">Wil Van Der Aalst</a> on so-called "<a href="http://www.workflowpatterns.com">workflow patterns</a>" (which would be more correctly called control-flow patterns).  Wil's work takes an internal view of control-flow in process description languages with an eye to classifying existing languages (like BPEL) and finding a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_point">triple point</a> where the expressiveness and efficiency of process description languages is simultaneously maximized.</p>
