One of the first pieces on its way is a nice <a href="http://egold.mitchellgold.com/hc/product.asp?dept%5Fid=1&amp;pf%5Fid=714%2D005L">armchair</a> with more or less the same classic lines as my old, red thinking chair.  I bought the red chair in the summer of 1989 or 1990, already in sub-par condition, at a garage sale for $3 and carried it home.  The red chair is where I did almost all of my thinking and writing, and it followed me from Reed to Berkeley to Chicago, where it was donated to chairity (<em>sic.</em>) in 2003.  I can only hope that it didn't fall into the wrong hands...</p>

<p>I've been wondering about the ambient context for my most productive thinking sessions, both foreground (thinking about things on purpose) and background (getting ideas spontaneously).  For foreground thinking, I like an armchair, clean sheets of white paper, a decent black pen (i.e., not a ball point), and either colored pencils or crayons.  A good-sized blackboard (<em>not</em> a whiteboard!!) with colored chalk and room to pace around will also work, and for some purposes, so will a text editor or word processor if I pretend that the formatting capabilities aren't there.  I also prefer private, open space.  (As for sharing an office, you might as well get the <a href="http://instruct.westvalley.edu/lafave/hb.html">Handicapper General</a> to fit me for headphones that play a loud noise at random but frequent intervals...)  For background thinking, I like a walk or run, a shower, a drive, doing yard work, or something else to keep my lizard brain busy and focus my attention.</p>
