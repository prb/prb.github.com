<p>Last year in the US, credit card issuers <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BFDA6B3FA%2DC961%2D4FCE%2DA31A%2D745C9F28BA84%7D&amp;dist=rss&amp;siteid=mktw">sent</a> on the order of one &#8220;pre-approved&#8221; offer for every man, woman, and child on the planet.  I know that they sent at least one to a child, as the kid got an invitation after she signed up as a frequent flier on United.  It might be scarier that 0.3% of the offers (6x10<sup>8</sup> &middot; 3x10<sup>-3</sup> = 1.8x10<sup>6</sup>) were accepted.</p>

<p>Surely there are better reasons to kill trees than just to fill landfills and recycling bins...</p>
