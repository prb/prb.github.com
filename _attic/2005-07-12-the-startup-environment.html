<p>People sometimes talk about a company having a "startup environment".  This usually means less organizational structure and with that the perception of greater agility for the business, but at least to me, a relaxed organizational attitude is not the kernel of truth at the heart of a (successful) startup.  A "startup environment" should indicate the presence of a single shared vision backed by clearly articulated, simple plans.</p>
