<p>Albert Einstein is <a href="http://en.thinkexist.com/quotation/the_most_powerful_force_in_the_universe_is/158830.html">credited</a> with saying that "Compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe."  True or false, compound interest and its exponential brethren are certainly among of the most inscrutable forces in the universe, as evidenced by <a href="http://www.sec.gov/answers/ponzi.htm">Ponzi schemes</a>, <a href="http://www.sfheart.com/tulip.html">flower frenzies</a>, and most recently the Internet bubble.</p>

<p>Free and open source software (FOSS) is fascinating stuff, but it's also a red herring for the same <a href="http://blog.fivesight.com/prb/space/2003-11-02#IT_Productivity_and_The_Real_New_Economy">reason</a> that the Internet was a red herring during the bubble:</p>

<blockquote><em>No technology or technique permits the suspension of fundamental economics for an infinitely long time.</em></blockquote>

<p>Someone, at some point, has to pay more for something than that something cost to produce.  There are a set of natural questions for the FOSS entrepreneur to answer, and the basics are the same as for any other business:</p>

<blockquote>What do you sell?  What does it cost you to manufacture or procure it?  To whom do you sell it?  By what means?  For how much?  How many potential customers are there?  How do you generate repeat business or other recurring revenue?  Who are your competitors?  What are the barriers to entry?</blockquote>

<p>The questions about competitors and barriers to entry are the most challenging for a would-be FOSS business -- What would prevent someone from creating something more free or more open and otherwise replicating your business model?  How do you prevent a "commercial" business from profiting from your efforts without supporting them?  The psychology of the customer is one of the keys to FOSS, so the challenge is that any defensive measures must be implemented in a way that does not topple with any of the pillars of good FOSS citizenship.  The naive solutions aren't going to fool any of the faithful.  For example, using traditional intellectual property protections like patents (in traditional ways) would be unthinkable, offering a low-end freebie under a GPL license as a lead-in to a traditionally licensed product would be heresy, and asking people to register for downloads or access to documentation would be in exceedingly poor taste.</p>

<p>So, where will the FOSS Amazon.com or Yahoo! come from?  There are plenty of interesting case studies out there: <a href="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> are well-enough studied that there are business journal articles about them, and companies like <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">Sleepycat</a> and <a href="http://www.zope.com">Zope</a> are a little more off the beaten path but still accessible.  Venture capitalists appear somewhat willing to spend money on FOSS business strategies, and people steeped in the community (e.g., <a href="http://www.openxource.com/crossings/latest.html">Bob</a>) are thinking about the practical challenges in FOSS.</p>

<p>Personally, I don't think there's any <big>big</big> money to be made in FOSS.  (In an analogy with the Internet, it's like being a bandwidth provider or hosting company...)  People will become well-known and may be financially comfortable running lifestyle businesses, and some people may even become rich; but no one is going to get wealthy directly.  (I'm using the <a href="http://www.chrisrock.com/">Chris Rock</a> scale of money here &#8212; <a href="http://www.nba.com/playerfile/shaquille_oneal/">Shaquille O'Neal</a> is <em>rich</em>, but the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/finance/lists/10/2004/LIR.jhtml?passListId=10&amp;passYear=2004&amp;passListType=Person&amp;uniqueId=OAU8&amp;datatype=Person">guy</a> who signs his paychecks is <em>wealthy</em>...)  The FOSS Amazon.com or Yahoo! will have a business model based secondarily on open source, whether it's support, services, management, or (hopefully) something more creative, only time will tell.</p>
