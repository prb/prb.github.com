<p>I'm definitely on the more stringent side when it comes to preferences about revision control.  Among other things, if it's worth checking in, it's worth commenting.</p>

<p>Presuming you already know a little bit about CVS commit <a href="https://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs-1.11.17/cvs_18.html#SEC167">support files</a>, here's a quick CVS hack that forces developers to write meaningful comments:</p>

<pre class="code">#!/bin/bash
LEN=`cat $1 | tr -d [:space:] | wc -c`
# loophole for bugfixes and build number management.
if egrep &quot;(BUILDNUMBER)&quot; $1; then
  exit 0
fi
if [ $LEN -le 40 ]; then
  echo &quot;Please enter a real comment; $LEN non-whitespace characters is pretty short...&quot;
  exit 1
fi
exit 0</pre>

<p>And then, in the <code>verifymsg</code> file in <code>CVSROOT</code> (with <code>project</code> replaced by the name of the project of interest):</p>

<pre class="code">^project $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/checkCommentLength.sh</pre>
