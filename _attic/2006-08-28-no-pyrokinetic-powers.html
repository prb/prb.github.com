<p>The kid is a teething machine, by which I mean that she has quite a few teeth for a sixteen-month-old, and she's getting more with her top and bottom canines on their way in and then only her four back molars left.  Combine this with a normal amount of toddler testiness, and you've got a recipe for some pretty good outbursts.  This past weekend, we were having lunch, and her mood came to a head.  She picked up her plate with clear intent to throw it, but I caught her in mid wind-up.  Her response to a stern &quot;No.&quot; was a seething look of anger that turned her whole face bright red.</p>

<p>After she was cleaned up and running around, my wife commented, &quot;It's good that she doesn't have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrokinesis">pyrokinetic</a> powers, or she'd have burned you into a little potato chip.&quot;  Nonetheless, I'll be on the lookout when she hits puberty...</p>
