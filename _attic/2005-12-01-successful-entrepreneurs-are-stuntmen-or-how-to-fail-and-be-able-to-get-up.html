<p><a href="http://www.steveshu.typepad.com/">Steve Shu</a>'s entry about <a href="http://steveshu.typepad.com/steve_shus_weblog/2005/04/where_cockroach.html">cockroaches</a> got me thinking about the flip side of being resourceful and resilient &#8212; <em>failure</em>.  It's a shame that failure and mistakes have such a negative connotation, because neither need be negative.</p><p>I've been meaning to blog about failure as a necessary part of entrepreneurship and a skill to master.  The mythology of entrepreneurship is full of people whose "sticktuitiveness" sees them through in the end.  Sorry if you just bought a bunch of <a href="http://www.ihot.com/~has/">Horatio Alger</a> books, but that's <a href="http://www.cowpieclocks.com/clockexample2.html">bu115h!t</a>&#8212; more likely than not, those people were continuously questioning their intuition, making subtle adjustments, learning from the mistakes of others, abandoning non-working ideas, and building new relationships.  Or they were simply in the right place at the right time.  (Maybe that "or" should be an "and"...)</p><p>Not being willing to fail is a curse for the clever.  Clever folk aren't used to failing as a natural occurrence, since the contrived educational system only puts solvable problems in front of students.  Worse, they're usually clever enough to figure out to how to stay afloat in difficult seas when sinking and starting over might be a shorter path to success.</p><p>Note that I'm not advocating giving up easily or failing spectacularly.  Rather, I'm advocating failure in small, frequent, and controlled doses as means of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NewtonsMethod.html">iterating</a> toward a successful outcome.</p>
