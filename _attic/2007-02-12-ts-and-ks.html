<p>The kid's vocabulary is growing quickly, she says "please" once in a while without being prompted, and she understands ownership ("dada's chair", "mama's shoes", etc.)  Just the same, she confuses "t" sounds and "k" sounds some of the time.  Her version of "OK" makes me think of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxQ2g24C1os">classic</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy">Eddie Murphy</a> on SNL, back when it was funny.  Sometimes, it makes it difficult for me to understand what she wants, but with practice, I think I've more or less got it down. The other day, she came to me and said, "Dada... titty... see!"  Being an attentive father, I hustled in to see her favorite stuffed <em>k</em>itty tucked into her bed...</p>
