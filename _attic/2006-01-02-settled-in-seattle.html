<p>I'm sure that someone can outdo my current personal best for amount of life change in six months from April to October, but those six months have been a personal best for me that I hope will endure at least for a little while.  In chronological order: we welcomed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/p-r-b/tags/emme/">Emme</a>; FiveSight released <a href="http://pxe.fivesight.com">PXE</a> into open source; I retired from <a href="http://www.fivesight.com">FiveSight</a>; I took a position at <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>; I moved my (new) family out to Seattle, on Father's Day; I switched roles at Amazon, from <a href="http://www.allthingsdistributed.com">Werner</a>'s group to Global Payments; we sold our condo in Chicago; we bought a house in Seattle; and <a href="http://www.intalio.com">Intalio</a> acquired FiveSight.  The rest of the year, even considering that this was my first holiday crunch at Amazon, was quiet by comparison.</p>

<p>I was born and grew up in Portland and have always considered myself a Northwest ex-pat, so moving to Seattle has been a kind of homecoming.  I could write about the little differences between the Chicago and Northwest cultures, but I think the stark contrast between Seattle's <a href="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/util/About_SPU/Recycling_System/History_&amp;_Overview/Ban_on_Recyclables_in_Garbage/index.asp">progressive</a> <a href="http://www.ci.seattle.wa.us/util/About_SPU/Recycling_System/History_&amp;_Overview/RESIDENTIA_200312021144083.asp">residential recycling</a> program and Chicago's <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0501160324jan16,1,7955089.story">blue bag</a> <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0503200498mar20,1,5132451.story">charade</a> should be sufficient.  (The <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/251292_smoking08.html">smoking ban</a> is nice, too.)</p>

<p>Seattle itself has been great.  We spent a couple of months in temporary housing in <a href="http://www.belltown.org/">Belltown</a>, walking distance from the <a href="http://www.pikeplacemarket.org">Pike Place Market</a>.  And, with the last of the boxes finally getting emptied, we're settled into our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/p-r-b/73699832/">house</a> in <a href="http://www.fremontseattle.com/">Fremont</a>.  Among other things, we're a short walk from the <a href="http://www.zoo.org/">zoo</a>, close to <a href="http://www.lighthouseroasters.com/"><i>great</i> coffee</a>, <a href="http://cuban-food-usa.com/seattle_paseo.html">good sandwiches</a>, just up the hill from <a href="http://seattle.citysearch.com/profile/11477093/">amazing croissants</a> and a real <a href="http://www.fremontmarket.com/ballard/">farmer's market</a> in <a href="http://www.inballard.com/">Ballard</a>, and just across Aurora from <a href="http://www.tuttabellapizza.com/">good, authentic pizza</a> in <a href="http://www.wallingford.org/">Wallingford</a>.  (<a href="http://www.google.com/local?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=follia&amp;near=Chicago,+IL&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=locald&amp;radius=0.0&amp;latlng=41850000,-87650000,14039167167801995769">La Follia</a> is still better...)  Seattle does lack a world-class <a href="http://www.artic.edu/aic/">art museum</a>, but I'm willing to content myself with being close to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/noca/">North Cascades</a>, <a href="http://www.nps.gov/mora/">Mt. Rainier</a>, and <a href="http://www.nps.gov/olym/">Olympic</a> National Parks.</p>
