<p>From the CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/12/06/mall.shooting/index.html">story</a> about the shooting in Omaha:</p>

<blockquote><p>"He basically said how sorry he was for everything," Maruca Kovac said of the note. "He didn't want to be a burden to people and that he was a piece of s--- all of his life and that <em>now he'd be famous</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine.)  I don't understand why names and pictures and other information about killers and criminals is published by the media, as it effectively rewards the behavior.  Remember the victims, but let murderers die in anonymity.</p>
