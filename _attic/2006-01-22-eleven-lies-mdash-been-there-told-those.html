<p><a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a> posted <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/the_top_ten_lie_1.html">eleven lies</a> that entrepreneurs tell venture capitalists, although "Eleven Lies that Entrepreneurs Tell Themselves" would work fine as an alternate title.  Been there, told those.</p>

<p>Although FiveSight never raised venture capital, we tried a couple of times, and various people had varying small degrees of success convincing me to tell different shades of those 11 lies.  A few thoughts about the various lies, by category:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Analyst predictions and other forecasts.</b>  You should assume that the VC is at least as savvy as you are, so if it doesn't fool you, it won't fool them.  On the flipside, if it <em>does</em> fool them, then they're uncharacteristically thick for a VC and you don't want them or their money anywhere near your baby.</li>
<li><b>Uniqueness.</b>  Clever ideas often require educating the customer about the value, and that's a losing proposition.  You shouldn't have to convince your customers that they want to be your customers...</li>
<li><b>Beating the Big Boys.</b>  Small companies can innovate faster than large companies, but large companies can buy a little innovation and reach a market faster than a small company can ever burn money.  If Larry, Bill, Steve, or any other billionaire wants your niche, he can out-sell and out-market you without breaking a sweat.  On the other hand, if you can help that billionaire beat up on his buddies by getting him to market quicker or better, that's more interesting, but you need to pitch the billionaire and not a VC.</li>
<li><b>Patents.</b>  No amount of funding will enable you to win a money fight with a juggernaut like IBM, Google, Amazon, or Microsoft.  (One possible exception would be having a big university to back you.)  The patent may have value to a juggernaut in an acquisition scenario, but that means it's a secondary consideration for investors.</li>
</ul>

<p>What's the alternative to the eleven slide deck presenting your version of the eleven lies?  Planning and running  your business so that you don't have to lie at all.  Of course, that may also keep you out of VC's offices.  By the time that I had settled on FiveSight's path forward (and likely exit through acquisition), it was also clear that it wasn't a VC investment.</p>
