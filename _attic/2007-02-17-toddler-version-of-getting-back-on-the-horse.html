<p>The kid took a little spill at the playground today.  She was happily rocking away on one of these rocking contraptions that is a fixture on Seattle playgrounds, where the bottom portion is a heavy coil spring and the top is made out of plywood and metal to look like a motorcycle or a horse or whatever.  Then she stopped to look at her shoe.  I wandered around from behind her to look at her shoe, too, and as soon I was out from behind her, she pitched off backwards and landed flat on her back on packed sand.  A 30-inch drop is substantial when you're three feet tall...  This was my second fatherly failing of the day, although the earlier incident (wherein I put her shoes on the wrong feet) was more minor but probably still enough to knock me <a href="http://www.fatherhood.org/Gala/">out of contention</a>.</p>

<p>She's made of sturdy stuff and was just fine, but she was pretty upset nonetheless.  Once the wife had her calmed down, she trudged straight back, demanded to be put back on, and went back to happily rocking.  She's always been an intent and intense little person, although the more common manifestation has been "I am going to jump in that puddle, and there is nothing you can do to stop me.  Even if you pick me up kicking and screaming and carry me a few blocks away, I will find my way back..."  We've had hopes all along that her intensity would turn out to be a positive thing, and this was the first time that it looked like it might indeed.</p>
