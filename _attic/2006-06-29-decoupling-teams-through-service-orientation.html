<p>There is plenty of talk about service-orientation as a way to decompose software, but I've come to look at it differently.  Service-orientation is equally important as a way to decompose work.</p>

<p>As an impermeable barrier between the inside (i.e., implementation) of a service and the outside, service-orientation helps to reduce complexity of a larger system composed of multiple services.  (Pat Helland's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/dataoutsideinside.asp">paper</a> on &#8220;Data on the Outside vs. Data on the Inside&#8221; makes the case in detail.)  This is a good thing, but it's not a great thing.  Don't get me wrong &#8212; architecture requires a certain sensibility and flair, and there are plenty of deep thoughts yet to be thought about software.  Nonetheless, the majority of the complexity in software engineering lies in putting a system into production (and keeping it there), not in coming up with an elegant design.</p>

<p>Service orientation also decouples teams.  For example, the team working on the customer information system and the team working on the inventory management system only need to adhere to each other's service interfaces in order to collaborate.  There is a huge difference between an <em>interface</em> and an <em>implementation</em> as the vehicle for collaboration.  Once one system is built around the knowledge of something inside (i.e., the implementation of) another system, those two systems are rigidly linked, and this constrains the actions of both teams.  For two teams trying to evolve two systems, this isn't a significant burden, but for dozens of teams trying to evolve dozens of systems toward different goals, it is debilitating.</p>

<p>Some <a href="http://www.amazon.com">e-commerce leaders</a> <a href="http://www.acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=388">talk the talk</a> and walk the walk, but it doesn't take &#8220;<a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail459.html">interplanetary scale</a>&#8221; to realize the benefits.  Companies that ship complex, customized software to multiple customers have to manage the collaboration between product development and multiple professional services teams, and if they've done it for any length of time, they've probably encountered the challenge of migrating customizations between versions or even just between patches.  (I've even seen systems &#8212; from a safe distance &#8212; where the customizations cross multiple tiers.)  Trading communities are another example where service-orientation (albeit seldom SOAP/WSDL-style or even XML-based) or the lack thereof drives complexity and cost.</p>

<p>At any rate, yet another discussion thread on &#8220;business/IT alignment&#8221; in my inbox is what got me on the train of thought that spawned this entry, but I think that most such discussions miss the point.  I do see service-orientation as a way to help align business and IT by pairing the semantics of the business with the semantics of the services, but it's the business <em>of</em> IT where service orientation pays the strongest benefits.</p>
