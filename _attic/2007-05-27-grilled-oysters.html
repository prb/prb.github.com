<p>I grilled some oysters this weekend, and while I've eaten them grilled before, this is the first time I've done the grilling.  (<a href="http://www.taylorshellfishfarms.com/">Taylor Shellfish Farms</a> sells 4-6" oysters &#8212; bigger is better for grilling &#8212; at our local <a href="http://www.seattlefarmersmarkets.org/market/university/index.shtml">farmer's market</a> for $8/dozen, so it seemed like a low-risk experiment from a financial perspective.)  The recipe is of the two-ingredient variety that I like (ingredient one: food; ingredient two: fire), and six minutes on a very hot gas grill was sufficient to cook but not overcook the oysters.  The caveat is that when some of the oysters "pop" at around the five minute mark, they spew boiling hot oyster juice, but other than that, it was a simple and tasty meal.  I chose a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinot_blanc">pinot blanc</a> to accompany, which was an easy choice because it was the only white I had in the house, and it was a good pair.  There are lots of other <a href="http://www.taylorshellfishfarms.com/oysterwine/2007/pages/entry.html">good choices</a>.</p>
