<p>I originally ran into the de-motivational posters from <a href="http://www.despair.com/">Despair, Inc.</a> back in the late 1990's, and while the posters could be considered trite (although less so than the motivational posters they mock), Despair, Inc. is now producing <a href="http://www.despair.com/spin.html">video podcasts</a> and have published a 400+ page <a href="http://www.despair.com/artofde.html">book</a> with more bite.</p>

<p>The podcasts feel like a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001302/">Christopher Guest</a> mockumentary about a motivational speaker, and like the vignettes in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/">Spinal Tap</a> that evoke different bands, the sad kernel of truth in each of podcasts is that I've observed executives who emulate E.&#160;L. Kersten without realizing it...</p>
