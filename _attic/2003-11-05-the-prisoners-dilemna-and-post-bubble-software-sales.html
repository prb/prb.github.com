<p>The <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/PRISDIL.html">Prisoner's Dilemna</a> is a classic, simple game where players must choose between collusion and defection. The short summary is that collusion is preferable but requires trust between the participants, and thus the Prisoner's Dilemna is used to model many biological and economic scenarios.</p>

<h3>Vendor vs. Customer and Vendor vs. Vendor</h3>
<p>There are two Prisoner's Dilemna configurations in enterprise software sales: one between any one vendor and the customer, and one among the competing vendors. Consider the standard sales pitch: "We provide a total solution to every problem, and our total solution is better than the next guy's." The vendor knows that this is false, and the customer knows that this is false from experience if nothing else.</p>

<p>The vendors have to assume that at least one of the other vendors will optimistically assess their capabilities (i.e., be dishonest) in this fashion, so every vendor choose the defection option. (As an aside, optimistic assessment, within reason, is one strategy for building a business, i.e., sell what you can build, and the customer may actually win in the balance. However, unless that's something that can be replicated over and over, it's also a going out of business strategy, viz. <a href="http://www.mark-knutson.com/">Ponzi</a>.) Conversely, the customer genuinely wants to believe in an easy answer and chooses to trust every vendor who can make a credible case.</p>

<h3>Destructive Symbiosis</h3>
<p>Which came first, the expectation of easy answers or the dismissal of difficult questions? Either way, it's bad for all involved, as the frog and scorpion both drown.</p>

<p>I worked on an RFI a few days ago, answered "No" to things that our product didn't do, answered "Yes" to the things that it did, and ended up making the initial cut for the confused but pleasantly surprised customer. Time will tell if I made the right choice, but from my perspective, it was a simple proposition: why fight for a ticket to a losing game?</p>
