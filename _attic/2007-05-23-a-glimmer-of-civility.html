<p>While I'm fully prepared for whatever "the terrible twos" means for the kid, we had an entirely civilized father-daughter outing this past weekend, which is a far cry from some of our experiences past.  She did largely as she was asked, where I mean things like not running around in the parking lot, not jumping into puddles, not climbing into the faux tide pool with the starfish.  (The first stop on our father-daughter day out was the  <a href="http://www.seattleaquarium.org/">Seattle Aquarium</a>, which was both overly crowded and just OK.  I was spoiled by visiting the <a href="http://www.sheddaquarium.org/">Shedd</a> regularly in Chicago.)  The kid's tour de force for the day, however, was <em>sitting</em> through an entire meal.  Without being belted to her chair.</p>

<p>It was a great experience to just sit and have a conversation, albeit about whether or not bumblebees bite and what color lights are on top of police cars and fire engines.</p>
