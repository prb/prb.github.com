<p>I tried the <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> thing with <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> for a while, but then I went to dump my blogroll as an OPML (which gets processed by an XSLT stylesheet and posted in the right column on my blog), but all of the <tt>xmlUrl</tt> attributes were Bloglines-specific URLs.  That is, my blogroll was locked into Bloglines.  That annoyed me, especially since I wasn't informed of the lock-in in advance, so I reconstructed my subscriptions and dumped Bloglines.  (That was almost as bad as when a misbehaved hotel gateway b0rked my subscriptions by <tt>301</tt>'ing the feeds to their signup page when I connected to the hotel network.)</p>

<p>With the new version of NetNewsWire, <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">NewsGator</a> sync is now an option, and it appears to work correctly.  The web interface is automatically updated, as are remote aggregators when they poll the feeds, and the OMPL export is pristine.  Much better.</p>
