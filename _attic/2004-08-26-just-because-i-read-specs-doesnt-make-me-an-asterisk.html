<p>If <a

Vonnegut</a> were to draw my portrait according to <a

Pilgrim</a>, it would look like this:</p>

<p>I believe that specifications should be unambiguous for a large,
useful subset of the universe of possible instances and then
completely silent otherwise.  (People should <a

better</a> than to try for full coverage...)  It is incumbent on the
initial architects of a specification to ensure that the useful subset
is well-chosen and then up to the subsequent clients of the
specification to ensure that dependencies are restricted to the
unambiguous subset.</p>
