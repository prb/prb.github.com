<p>Steve Shu, who was <a href="http://www.fivesight.com/">FiveSight</a>'s "utility infielder" for almost four years (and, although I always kidded about him being the only guy who didn't code, an indispensible part of our team), has moved to Texas with his family, embarked on a new <a href="http://www.s4management.com/">joint venture</a> with his wife, and started <a href="http://sshu-s4.tripod.com/blog/">blogging</a> his thoughts about management and business.</p>

<p>It's a little odd to be a "startup" that's old enough to have alumni, but I hope Steve's time with us will serve him well in his new endeavors.</p>
