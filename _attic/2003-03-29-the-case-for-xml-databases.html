<p>On May 8, I will give a talk in the <a href="http://www.campconferences.com/expo/#Web">Web/XML</a> portion of the <a href="http://www.campconferences.com/expo/">CampIT Expo</a> in Chicago on "The Case for XML Databases". Here is the abstract:</p>

<blockquote>Unfortunately, the answer to the question, "So, why do I need an XML database?" is usually "Because it is better for XML storage." The real answer is that flexible storage for XML enables a host of interesting opportunities for managing and re-purposing enterprise content, and the rich array of XML standards &#8212; XSLT, XSL-FO, SVG &#8212; provide ways to deliver accessible presentations to a wide variety of corporate users.</blockquote>

<p>If you meet the qualifications, you can <a href="http://www.campconferences.com/expo/expoRegistration.htm">register</a> to go to the conference for free; alternatively, I'm willing to send out copies of the slides after the presentation.</p>
