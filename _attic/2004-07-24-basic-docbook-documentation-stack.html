<p>I've been working with DocBook and thinking about software documentation, and as a prelude to some entries with tips and thoughts about what I wish existed, I thought I would share what I'm currently using.  The following combination works reasonably well:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/">DocBook XML</a> (with the <a href="http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook.html">on-line book</a> as a crutch)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a> (in a Mac OS X-specific <a href="http://www.sauria.com/blog/2004/06/27#991">package</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/download/">nxml mode</a> (with DocBook Relax NG <a href="http://www.docbook.org/rng/4.3/">schemas</a>) (For the uninitiated, here's a nice <a href="http://www.xmlhack.com/read.php?item=2061">overview</a>.)
<li><a href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/">DocBook XSL</a> (with the <a href="http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/">on-line book</a> as a crutch)</li>
<li><a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net">Saxon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.renderx.com/">RenderX XEP</a> (I've had too many problems with <a href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">FOP</a> to use it.)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a> manual as a staring point</li>
</li></ul>
