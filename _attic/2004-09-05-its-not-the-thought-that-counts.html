<p>Someone was recently described to me as an "idea guy", and on reflection, I suppose that it's true -- the person in question <em>does</em> have a number of ideas.  Unfortunately, he is unable to discern a good idea from a bad idea, which makes him completely useless.  If someone is a "<em>good</em> idea guy", then I'm interested.</p>
