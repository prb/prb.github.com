<p>I was happy to find, via <a
href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2005/12/then_you_win.html">Bill de
h&Oacute;ra</a>, a <a
href="http://www.adamsmith.org/logicalfallacies">blog</a> on logical
fallacies:</p>

<blockquote><small>The fallacist, like the zoo-keeper, develops an
affectionate relationship with his specimens. He keeps them correctly
labelled in their separate enclosures, and looks them over from time
to time pausing to stroke a petitio principii, or allowing
an ignoratio elenchi to nuzzle against his hand. [...] I take a very
broad view of fallacies. Any trick of logic or language which allows a
statement or a claim to be passed off as something it is not, has an
admission card to the enclosure reserved for
fallacies.</small></blockquote>

<p>Fallacy fanciers may also enjoy a trip to <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/djb.html">Dan Bernstein</a>'s <a
href="http://cr.yp.to/postpropter.html">collection</a> of <i>post hoc
ergo propter hoc</i> instances collected from the wild.</p>
