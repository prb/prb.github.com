<p>The kid developed a pretty nasty rash of unknown origin after dinner today, so we called the on-call advice nurse.  After a few not-so-fruitful rounds of questions about what the rash looked like, I grabbed a couple of digital pictures, posted them to Flickr, and gave the nurse the URL over the phone.  (I took the pictures down after the call was over.)  A cool bath followed by some  hydrocortisone, and peace returned to our household.  No Bendryl for the kid if we can avoid it, as it seems to function as a strong stimulant in her case; the one time we gave it to her at 10PM, she literally ran laps around her room for four hours...</p>

<p>This brings to mind an idea for a software business &#8212; branded, private, secure photosharing portals for physician's offices and hospitals that provide advice over the phone.  The portal would provide secure, permanent storage for the images and integration with the medical record system.</p>
