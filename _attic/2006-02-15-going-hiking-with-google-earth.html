<p>Now that I can run <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> on my Mac (finally), I tried looking up some of the more out of the way places that I've been and was pleasantly surprised to find that trails in some of the National Parks (e.g., <a href="http://www.nps.gov/noca/">North Cascades National Park</a>) are marked!  It's hardly a replacement for a good topographical map, but it does help put things in proper perspective.  For example, the mountain goats below are standing just about where the trail goes over the pass.  (There were a bunch of marmots running around that day, too, but I didn't get good pictures of them.)</p>
