<p>An <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/01/02/get_my_stuff_done.html">entry</a> on <a href="http://www.boingboing.net">Boing Boing</a> has a link to an <a href="http://www.i-am-bored.com/bored_link.cfm?link_id=7240">animated version</a> of an anti-pattern in productivity.  This reminds me of some advice I got from a friend over a decade ago...</p>

<p>Sometime in early 1993, it was around 4AM, and I was in a room heated by a herd of humming <a href="http://www.sunstuff.org/hardware/systems/sun3/sun3/3-50/">SUN 3/50</a>'s with another graduate student.  (That room was on the 8<sup>th</sup> floor in the <a href="http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~tobin/wiki/moin.cgi/Evans_20Hall">building</a> where <a href="http://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/usd/12.vi/paper.html">vi</a> was written...)  He was finishing his dissertation, and I was preparing for my qualifying exams.  In conversation, I asked how he got started on his line of research.  His response was simple and succinct:</p>

<blockquote><em>The only way to get something done is to do it.</em></blockquote>

<p>A tautology at first glance, this is the only solution to the <a href="http://onthethought.blogspot.com/2005/01/productivity.html">preparation/refinement conundrum</a>.  As an argument against premature optimization, creating and experimenting with a prototype often supplies information that was previously unavailable, so many <em>a&#160;posteriori</em> conclusions could not have been drawn <em>a&#160;priori</em> anyway.</p>

<p>One suggestion along these lines is that <code>cat</code> makes a perfectly good text editor if you're suffering from writer's block.  Simply:</p>

<blockquote><pre><b>pbpbook$</b> cat - &gt;&gt; work.txt
Type.
Do not backspace; do not edit a line.
Hit enter frequently.
Do not exit until the thought has been expressed.<em>^C</em></pre></blockquote>

<p>In extreme cases of refine-itis, even a simple text editor can be too tempting.</p>
