<p>Pricing is a black art, especially when it comes to things like a company, a highly specialized piece of software, or a business relationship with intangible benefits.  The rookie mistake is to set the price according to the cost or even to use the cost as an anchor in explaining the price.  The <em>value to you</em> in whatever units (dollars, years, number of bowls of Top Ramen eaten, broken marriages, quatloos, whatever...) is irrelevant to the purchaser, while the <em>value to them</em> is some proportion more than you can expect a rational actor to be willing to pay.</p>

<p>Putting the cost on the table in front of the potential purchaser can only weaken your position.  Instead, keep the discussion focused on the value and how to ensure that the purchaser realizes it.  If they try to low ball you, just say "no"; there's no need to justify it or explain your reasoning.</p>
