<p>I have a few hundred DRM-hobbled MP3s from the iTunes Music Store, but I've decided that it no longer deserves my business.  Most of the music that I like is available DRM-free and in higher-bitrate encoding from <a href="http://www.bleep.com">Bleep</a>, and when what I'm looking for is not available someplace like <a href="http://www.emusic.com">eMusic</a>, paying a little more for a CD will get me both a version that I can play on a <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com">Squeezebox</a> and the good feeling that I'm not supporting a world view that includes DRM.</p>

<p>I'm not opposed to rights, per se, but I like to be able to exercise them.  The iTunes model seemed reasonable enough, but the Squeezebox changed my mind.  I can't listen to iTunes-encrypted music on the Squeezebox because Apple hasn't licensed the necessary software to SlimDevices.  Why should I have to pay whatever incremental cost the licensing would add to the cost of the Squeezebox in order to exercise the rights that I purchased through iTunes?  (Yes, I realize that I can strip the DRM, use <a href="http://www.icecast.org/">icecast</a> to redirect audio streams, etc. &#8212; all of which is more trouble than paying the incremental cost of a CD.)</p>

<p>It wouldn't take much for someone to win my business &#8212; $1.50/song, $11/album, no DRM, high bitrate, critical mass of artists/labels, and something reasonable for community (&#8220;also bought&#8221;, etc.) or similarity (e.g., <a href="http://www.musicgenome.com/">taxonomy</a>).  Any takers for iTunes &#8220;2.0&#8221;?  (No, the subscription models from <a href="http://www.real.com/rhapsody">Real</a> and <a href="http://music.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> are just 1.1 efforts in my view.)</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> It <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060313/wr_nm/media_france_copyrights_dc">looks like</a> the French have similar sensibilities:</p>

<blockquote>[...] &#8220;It will force some proprietary systems to be opened up ... You have to be able to download content and play it on any device,&#8221; Vanneste told Reuters in a telephone interview on Monday [...]</blockquote>

<p>Good wine, good food, device independence...  Vive la France!</p>
