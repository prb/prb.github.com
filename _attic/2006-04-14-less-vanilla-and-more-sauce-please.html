<p>For the record, I like <a href="http://calendar.google.com">Google Calendar</a>, and it's probably going to replace <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ical/">iCal</a> as my primary calendaring tool.  I've already set up iCal as a client by subscribing to my Google calendar, and this will solve the problem of synchronizing calendars on multiple machines and being able to update the calendar from a remote location.</p>

<p>A solid online calendar is good, but I was hoping for something a little saucier.  My wishlist:</p>

<ul>
<li>A web service interface for managing events and checking free/busy status.  For instance, I'd like to be able to provide a generic method for people to request a meeting with me or figure out when I'm free for lunch.  (Yahoo!'s <a href="http://calendar.yahoo.com">calendar</a> has a feature like this, IIRC.)</li>

<li>I got addicted to labels (i.e., tags) in <a href="http://mail.google.com">GMail</a>, and I miss having them in the calendar.  For example, I would like my &#8220;home&#8221; and &#8220;work&#8221; calendars to contribute to a single, aggregate availability indicator, but I wouldn't want the details of &#8220;home&#8221; events to be visible to &#8220;work&#8221;.  (One program that fulfills this requirement, if a bit obliquely, is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/entourage2004/entourage2004.aspx?pid=entourage2004">Microsoft Entourage</a> through what it calls &#8220;projects&#8221;.)</li>

<li>I'd like the labels and addresses that I've built up in GMail to be shared with the calendar and vice versa, e.g., so that I can look up everything related to a given topic via a label.</li>

</ul>

<p>And I'd love to have something more or less like <a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailTags.html">MailTags</a> for GMail with the ability to spawn time-bound tasks from an email.  MailTags uses the &#8220;URL&#8221; field in the task within iCal to store a <tt>file://...</tt> link back to the mail item, and that bidirectional association is convenient for providing context.  Of course, this would require that there be support for tasks on the Google platform, but I can only assume that it's in the works.  (Maybe it will be called &#8220;Google-To-Doogle&#8221;?  Feel free to use the name...)</p>

<p>Maybe a Google <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gtd">GTD</a> implemented via <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> is only a little while away?</p>
