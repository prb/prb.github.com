<p><a href="http://www.iona.com/info/aboutus/management/eric_newcomer.htm">Eric Newcomer</a> (<a href="http://www.iona.com">IONA</a>'s CTO and a heavyweight technologist) wrote a thoughtful piece on <a href="http://www.cnet.com">C|Net</a> called "<a href="http://news.com.com/2010-1071-984885.html">The Web Services Shell Game</a>". I would like to quote the whole thing, but this paragraph in particular stuck with me:</p>

<blockquote>The market leaders are scared that comprehensively adopted Web services standards will change the economics of the software industry and make their investments in current products unsustainable. The choice for these vendors is to start over and risk losing market share or to try and control the revolution. Not surprisingly, these companies choose the latter option.</blockquote>

<p>I have nothing to add. </p>
