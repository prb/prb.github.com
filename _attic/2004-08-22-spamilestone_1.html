<p>My spam corpus has just crossed 60,000 messages, so it's time for a quick retrospective on the last 10,000 messages.  For that group, <a href="http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/">bogofilter</a> looks to be around 87% at catching spam with a 99% "bogosity" threshold with no false positives, and relaxing the "bogosity" threshold to 90% would have made it 99% effective.</p>
