<p>Just saw <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml07/07212.html">this</a> over <a href="http://www.thingamababy.com/baby/2007/06/recall.html">on</a> Thingamababy:</p>

<blockquote>RC2 Corp. Recalls Various Thomas &#38; Friends&#8482; Wooden Railway Toys Due to Lead Poisoning Hazard [...] Manufactured in: China [...]</blockquote>

<p>While this is not necessarily an example of the same kind of wanton (wonton?) disregard for health and well-being as <a href="http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/petfood.html">melamine in pet food</a> and the ensuing food safety debacle, there won't be any more Chinese-made toys (or food or anything else) in our house until we've got a good reason to believe that their safety standards are significantly higher.  As I understand it, lead paint <em>dust</em> is the <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/CPSCPUB/PUBS/5054.html">major hazard</a> as opposed to skin contact with intact lead paint, so the kid probably consumed very little if any lead playing with the toy trains.  But that's not the point.</p>

<p>This is a failure on the part of the distributor to properly monitor and police their suppliers &#8212; someone at some level at some point knew better.  Class action anyone?</p>
