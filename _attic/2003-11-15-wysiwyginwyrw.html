<p>I've spent time this weekend working on a couple of book chapters in Microsoft Word.  After a few hours wasted pasting and repasting code snippets and tagging text with different formats, I've come to the conclusion that WYSIWYGINWYW, i.e., WYSIWYG (<strong>w</strong>hat <strong>y</strong>ou <strong>s</strong>ee <strong>i</strong>s <strong>w</strong>hat <strong>y</strong>ou <strong>g</strong>et) <strong>i</strong>s <strong>n</strong>ot <strong>w</strong>hat <strong>y</strong>ou <strong>r</strong>eally <strong>w</strong>ant.  At least, it's not what <strong>I</strong> really want. With the millions of lines of code and thousands upon thousands of hours of testing and refinement in Microsoft Word, has it really gotten us anywhere? I suspect that the <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/cf_0/m5072/17_22/61894566/print.jhtml">$10B annual cost</a> of solitaire and other games in the workplace pales in comparison to the time spent tweaking bullets, mapping to and from outlining formats, and dealing with header/footer transitions.</p>

<p>I will admit to being "old school" in that I like to put two spaces after a period even though aesthetically challenged people insist that it's no longer necessary with proportional-width fonts. (See, e.g., this <a href="http://www.webword.com/reports/period.html">note</a>.)  My progression of text creation devices started with a mechanical typewriter that jammed if I typed more than 35-40 words per minute, and progressed through DOS versions of WordPerfect and Microsoft Word on the Mac to <a href="http://www.tug.org/">T<sub>E</sub>X</a>, which served me well from 1989-1999 (other than a brief detour into <a href="http://troff.org/">troff</a>). And then it was back to Microsoft Word for "collaboration" with others, but using the <a href="http://www.snipsnap.org/space/snipsnap-help">markup</a> in <a href="http://www.snipsnap.org">SnipSnap</a> is making me nostalgic.</p>

<p>I want:</p>

<ul>
<li>a textual format that is amenable to diff, patch, and revision tracking tools;</li>
<li>relatively simple markup like <a href="http://wiki.org/">wiki</a> or TeX that is less limited than <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/">HTML</a> and less daunting than <a href="http://www.docbook.org/">DocBook</a>;</li>
<li>support for code (like DocBook or SnipSnap's <code>{code}</code> macro) but with TeX's uniform support for both inline and displayed elements;</li>
<li>support for in-line annotations (like DocBook); and</li>
<li>straightforward management of inclusions and artifacts (like table of contents or indexes).</li>
</ul>

<p>And I want my coauthors and coworkers to like the fact that I use it.</p>
