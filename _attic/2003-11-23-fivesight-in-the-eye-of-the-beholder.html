<p>I'm playing the role of entrepreneur for a group of <a href="http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/">business school</a> students studying how executives build and maintain personal networks, and I liked the way that the interviewer described our offices:</p>

<blockquote>Fivesight is located in an unassuming loft space in Chicago's West Loop area. It is a large office space, with a very informal, comfortable d&#233;cor. [...] Every available space seemed filled with computers, laptops, books and software paraphernalia of every imaginable kind. The layout seemed very informal, no individual offices, equal access to company resources.</blockquote>

<p>And there's all the <a href="http://www.peets.com/">Peet's</a> you can drink. Sounds like my kind of place.</p>
