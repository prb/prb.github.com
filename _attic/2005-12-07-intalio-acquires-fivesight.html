<p>On December 6, <a href="http://www.intalio.com">Intalio</a> <a href="http://www.intalio.com/news/releases/20051206-FiveSight.html">announced</a> that it acquired <a href="http://www.fivesight.com">FiveSight</a>, the company that I founded in 1999 and then led through six years of ups and downs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.s4management.com/">SteveShu</a> has a few <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SteveShusBlog?m=326">comments</a> on the FiveSight experience.  (Steve has always been too humble for his own good; he was a vital member of the team from the moment he joined and played a key role in every win that the company had, including our relationship with Union Pacific and our distribution partner in Japan.)  I can still remember Steve's first day on November 6, 2000.  He showed up at my apartment in Chicago, and we went over FiveSight's "books" (an Excel sheet) at the kitchen table.  That was just before FiveSight kicked-off in earnest with the original crew of six in a big loft in downtown Chicago, complete with a coffee maker, a pool table, and a fish tank.</p>

<p>Looking back, I like to think of FiveSight like a piece of software.  We had a pretty good v1.0 release with a good product and some great customers, all driven by the moxie to turn minimal funding and maximal ambition into a going concern.  FiveSight v1.0 won awards for rapid growth (426% for 2002, not half bad...) from <a href="http://quickstart.clari.net/qs_se/webnews/wed/bt/Bil-deloitte-_-touche.ROvd_DSM.html">Deloitte &amp; Touche</a> and the <a href="http://www.csa.org/sourcecode/january2004.aspx">Chicago Software Association</a>.  We hit growing pains in 2003, trying to get over the $3M/year revenue hump against an increasingly competitive Java EAI market and the IT spending doldrums that followed the bubble burst and the 9/11 attack.</p>

<p>PXE was FiveSight's v2.0 business.  We took stock in the middle of 2003, ramped-down FiveSight v1.0, and decided to bet on BPEL as a standard that would decouple design and protocols from execution.  The first version of the BPM component for our previous platform morphed into Maciej's elegant design for the <a href="http://pxe.fivesight.com">PXE</a> execution core, and we were off to the races with an OEM-focused strategy that emphasized our strengths in low-level Java and high-level, targeted sales focused on the build/buy proposition.  (I picked <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com">Sleepycat</a> (for their OEM business) and <a href="http://www.zope.com">Zope</a> (for their community) as businesses to emulate, but I also started with the assumption that the market for BPEL execution and the overall market context would be completely different &#8212; FiveSight v2.0 would have to find its own way.)  Open source was part of the thinking from the beginning but not part of the public strategy until June of 2005, when we posted PXE as open source to accompany SUN's tooling demo at JavaOne.</p>

<p>I'll be watching Intalio's progress from my <a href="http://www.amazon.com">seat</a> on the sidelines, but more on that later.</p>
