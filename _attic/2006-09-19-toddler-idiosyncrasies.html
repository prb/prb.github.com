<p>The kid is really starting to develop some personality, and her growing capabilities make it more fun to be a father.  (Don't get me wrong, babies are wonderful blah blah, but toddlers are <em>even better</em>.)  She can take multi-step commands, and she understands that Mom and Dad can help with things like hurting teeth or itches.  She taught herself to do a somersault, spontaneously stacks objects, colors randomly on place mats at restaurants (whether or not they're intended for that purpose), and skipped right past shape-sorting toys to putting pry-out pieces back into a multi-page book.</p>

<p>So far, so good.  The weird thing is that she's also developing quirks.  I was giving her a bath tonight and turned my back for a split second to put something away, and she let out a blood curdling scream.  She was standing in the tub with a serious expression on her face, arm stuck straight out, pointing to a small fleck of dirt floating in the tub.  I fished it out, and she went back to pouring water from one cup into another like nothing had happened.  It's very difficult to be a neat freak as a baby, where the difference between food, finger paint, and hair gel is situational, but she's showing a definite trend now.  This is just one instance; for example, she behaved similarly after dropping a piece of food on the mat that sits under her highchair.  A month ago, the mat was there to protect the floor, but today, she feels that it's important to keep it clean.</p>

<p>Who knows whether the kid will carry this into adulthood or even into next week, but the nascent idiosyncrasies are one of the things that makes her more fun.</p>
