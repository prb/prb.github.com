<p>I read an article somewhere (<a href="http://www.nyt.com">NYT</a>, maybe?) recently about the fact that even with tax breaks and subsidies, hybrid cars are not a winning economic proposition.  Nonetheless, people buy them for non-economic reasons, as a social and political statement.  This is certainly not a new behavior, as most people who own fast cars in big cities don't actually drive them fast from stoplight to stoplight.  Come to think of it, it's about the opposite &#8212; the people I remember driving like maniacs on the Chicago freeways were usually in low-end Japanese cars with lots of primer spots and great big spoilers to metaphorically show their manhood.</p>

<p>Since we're a Northwest-living, organic-food-eating, hybrid-car-contemplating, trash-recycling, sandal-wearing, co-sleeping, photovoltaic array-considering, eco-touring family that would otherwise fall into the yuppie demographic, that now makes us &#8220;greenies&#8221;.  (&#8220;Guppie&#8221; is becoming an <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0426/p03s01-ussc.html">official</a> term, but I like "greenie" better...)  I was thinking about greenies as an economic force yesterday when we were at <a href="http://www.rei.com/">REI</a> with the kid.  There were a lot of other families shopping, too, with kids and strollers, except that unlike the usual mix of Graco and the occasional Maclaren in the rest of Seattle, <em>every</em> stroller was a <a href="http://www.bugaboo.com/">Bugaboo</a>.</p>

<p>I'm happy with &#8220;less of better&#8221; being a mantra for my generation, but I can't help but think that the majority are in the &#8220;more of whatever is on TV&#8221; WalMart Nation instead.</p>
