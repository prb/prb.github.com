<p>Not so long ago, I used an ATM ("automated teller machine", called other things by people in other parts of the world) just down the street from our condo in Chicago.  According to the bank's fraud detection folks, that ATM has been used for a good amount of suspicious activity, so they suspended my ATM card.  Then, the next morning, they called to badger my wife about it:</p>

<blockquote><b>Bank:</b> Hello, this is Bank X.  We need to speak to Mr. Brown.<br />
<b>Mrs. Brown:</b> He's not here, but I'm his wife.  How can I help you?<br />
<b>Bank:</b> Please give us your husband's social security number for verification purposes.<br />
<b>Mrs. Brown:</b> No.  How about you prove to me who you are first?</blockquote>

<p>And that went around in circles for a few iterations, ending in stalemate.  My wife was right, and I'm not just saying that...  The caller supposedly from our bank could have been anyone who might have guessed the name of our bank and decided to phish by phone.</p>

<p>Phishing and other phorms of phraud have highlighted that fact that identity is a symmetric problem while most solutions are one-sided.  So, how about, for every account that a user has with a provider, <em>both</em> the user and the provider have the means to authenticate each other?  A naive solution could be as simple as having two passwords -- one to give and one to receive.</p>
