<p>I left my position at Amazon at the end of March, and after pretty much not taking a break for almost seven years, I've been enjoying some time off.  (I'm serious about not taking a break &#8212; for example, I was hitting Internet cafes during our honeymoon in Italy to check the status of FiveSight's Series A negotiations and read drafts of agreements.)</p>

<p>The odd thing is, like people who are genuinely retired, I find my time filled anyway, albeit with reconnecting with people I haven't talked to recently, checking out the local parks, tinkering with software, or grabbing breakfast at a sidewalk bakery/cafe while the kid runs around.  (FWIW, I've decided that referring to my daughter by name in my blog either is or should be irrelevant to my readers who aren't otherwise friends in the real world.)  It's entirely pleasant.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I think that 60 days of this is about all I can stand, so my &#8220;v.next&#8221; kicks off in June.  </p>
