<p>Three random thoughts for the day:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the Internet is converging on a collective consciousness, then it doesn't surprise me that it's full of relatively low-brow content.</li>
<li>I wish that the people who designed our <a href="http://www.amana.com/catalog/product.jsp?parentCategoryId=585&amp;categoryId=594&amp;productId=1368&amp;scr=category">gas range</a> had provided it with controls that made it impossible to turn on a burner with my ass.</li>
<li>Like lots of other folks, I was hoping to spend this weekend reading a hot new <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/">book</a>, but my (hard) copy hasn't yet arrived.</li>
</ul>
