<p>Most of the bug/issue tracking systems that I've worked with have &#8220;worksforme&#8221; as a common end-state for a bug or issue, e.g., in <a href="http://www.edgewall.com/trac/">Trac</a> or <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/jira">Jira</a>, but I'm opposed to its use.  (I see bugs and issues as <a href="http://blog.prb.io/bugs-are-not-issues-and-vice-versa.html">distinct</a> entities.)</p>

<p>For a <em>bug</em>, &#8220;worksforme&#8221; is irrelevant.  A bug is already a well-defined and specific flaw in the software, so either a fix is completed and tested or it isn't.  If the faulty code is no longer in use, then the bug is &#8220;vacuouslyfixed&#8221; or &#8220;nolongerrelevant&#8221; or some such.</p>

<p>For an <em>issue</em>, &#8220;worksforme&#8221; is potentially applicable but still semantically incorrect.  Valid and semantically consistent states in the issue lifecycle might be &#8220;expectedbehavior&#8221; or &#8220;usererror&#8221; or &#8220;needmoreinfo&#8221; or &#8220;unabletoreproduce&#8221;, and even so &#8220;needmoreinfo&#8221; or &#8220;unabletoreproduce&#8221; aren't necessarily terminal states.  The &#8220;worksforme&#8221; is at best dismissive and at worst a flippant if not inflammatory message to the customer.</p>
