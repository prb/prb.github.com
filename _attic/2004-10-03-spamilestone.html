<p>My spam corpus has just crossed 70,000 messages, so it's time for a quick retrospective on the last 10,000 messages.  It looks like spam is picking up speed, with ~240/day (peaks over 300/day) for the last 10,000 versus ~215/day for the 10,000 before last and ~205/day for the 10,000 before that.  With this last set of messages, the distribution of spam probabilities (as rated by <a href="http://bogofilter.sourceforge.net/">bogofilter</a>) is starting to flatten out a bit, so I'll probably have to tune the paramters or add an additional type of filter.</p>
