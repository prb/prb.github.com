<p>The mouse has its place, but I've never been that fond of the degree to which use of the mouse is required in many GUIs.  (I'll take the position that anything that can reasonably be done without the mouse should be.)  <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">QuickSilver</a> was a giant leap forward in de-emphasizing the mouse, and <a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html">Mail ActOn</a> helped; but the browser was largely the domain of the mouse.  Now the <a href="http://conkeror.mozdev.org/">Conkeror</a> extension for Firefox takes a step toward mouse-free browsing with an interface that seldom requires taking hands away from the keyboard.  In addition to Emacs-ish key bindings (including for text areas) and conveniences (like <tt>c</tt> to copy the current URL to the clipboard), Conkeror numbers the links and form elements on a page for random access (as opposed to the sequential access provided by <tt>TAB</tt>'ing in a traditional browser interface), and so far it's an improvement.  (This approach does run afoul of really fancy interfaces like GMail, but the mouse remains usable for those situations.)</p>

<p>Conkeror also has a nice feature called &#8220;webjumps&#8221; (derived from an Emacs <a href="http://www.neilvandyke.org/webjump/">feature</a> of the same name) that reminds me a bit of <a href="http://yubnub.org/">YubNub</a>.   For example, to find out how far below hair care brands, the NPR Paul Brown, and famous football coaches I rank on Google, I type <tt>g</tt> followed by <tt>google Paul Brown</tt>.  Or, to add the current URL to my <a href="http://del.icio.us/prb">del.icio.us</a> bookmarks, I type <tt>g</tt> followed by <tt>adelicious&#160;.</tt>.  This requires adding the line <tt>delicious_username=&#8220;prb&#8221;</tt> (in my case) to your <tt>~/.conkerorrc</tt> file and ensuring that Conkeror knows the location of your rc file by telling it on the help page (<tt>M-x&#160;help-page</tt>).  (The <tt>.</tt> in the del.icio.us webjump is just window dressing and could just as well be <tt>foo</tt> or whatever; the webjump doesn't take any arguments, but Conkeror doesn't interpret a URL as a webjump unless an argument is supplied...)</p>
