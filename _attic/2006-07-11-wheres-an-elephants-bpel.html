<p>The classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Men_and_an_Elephant">parable</a> of the blind men and the elephant applies to some recent proclamations about BPEL and BPMN (and about BPM and SOA, for that matter) being at odds, and there is long line of blind men waiting to take their crack at sizing-up the BPM elephant.  I started out believe that the elephant is defined by its back end, the execution aspects, and that's where FiveSight developed a specialty.  Nonetheless, customers (who wanted to ride on the elephant) educated me about its other properties, and combined with the expectation that standards would help define the parts of the BPM animal, the breadth of customer expectations is one of the things that drove our specialization.  In 2003, we set out to build the &#8220;best back-end in the business&#8221;, gave it the code name &#8220;JLo&#8221;, and took an OEM stance.  (Note to any entrepreneurs in the audience &#8212; Either you are an elephant vendor or your customers are the elephant vendors.  The middle ground is not populated by successful businesses.)</p>

<p>I still recall a customer encounter (probably from 2002) for FiveSight's BPM-ish product that predated our BPEL effort.  A customer was interested in an email widget to mass-mail customers.  (Never mind that mass emailing requires more than a bit of art in dealing uniformly with bounces, proper MIME enveloping for correct viewing by different clients, delivery throttling by large email account providers, etc.)  We built one more or less blind that wrapped up some of the usual <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">JavaMail</a> functionality and took a string as input for the body.  We showed it to the customer, including a sidebar about how easy it was to implement the widget complete with a code sample (&#8220;Even your IT staff could do it, Ms. Customer!&#8221; &lt;wink wink&gt;).  The business analyst spoke up and asked &#8220;Can it do RTF editing?  We'd like to have consistent branding with a logo and specific fonts.&#8221;  Ummm, yeah...</p>

<p><em>Aside:</em> Once upon a time, on a trip to Japan, I met someone whose title was actually &#8220;Business Analyst&#8221;.  I was tempted to frame his card.</p> 

<p>The point of the story is that there are modeling aspects and execution aspects to a process, and they are closely related but not equivalent.  BPMN is a <em>modeling notation</em> for describing processes in business terms.  BPEL is a <em>service orchestration language</em> for combining services that was designed specifically for a WSDL-based SOA.  It is possible, by design but not without effort, to generate orchestration language artifacts from modeling notation artifacts.  One could observe that if nothing below the model mattered, then the orchestration language is irrelevant, and that would be true if the processes lived in a closed, black box.  But that's <em>so</em> BPM&#160;0.9 &#8212; vendors should know better than to imagine that they can shoehorn their customers into an architectural stovepipe when there are other alternatives available.</p>

<p>Agility requires degrees of freedom, and the combination of BPMN and BPEL to bind the higher-level modeling aspects of BPM onto SOA provides two important degrees of freedom.  First, the modeling tool is decoupled from the execution environment.  (Note that a good backmapping from the BPEL to BPMN is important, but that's a property of the mapping used.)  Second, the processes are first-class citizens of a service-oriented architecture, fueling use and reuse outside of the context of the modeling environment.</p>
