<p>If you have a fully-funded company, either through investment or through being a going concern, then it's straightforward to work out compensation: pay people market rate or better salaries and award equity based on role and impact.  If the company is <em>not</em> fully funded, then how to allocate cash and equity is a more interesting question.  Here are some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Distinguish founders as people who have shares instead of options.  Being a shareholder should be considered a real privilege.</li>
<li>Set expectations up front among <em>all</em> employees that roles and relative compensation will change based on impact and the direction of the firm.  Compensation is about the present, not the past.</li>
<li>Set expectations among investors that dilution (e.g., via assignment of options) will be an ongoing phenomenon as long as the company needs to use equity instead of money.  Establishing a sufficiently large pool of equity and a timeframe for disbursement <em>prior</em> to taking investment will help set shareholder expectations.</li>
<li>Establish a uniform conversion between cash and stock and compensate employees at <em>at least</em> their fair market value.</li>
<li>Limit the number of employees who have a large proportion (&gt;15%) of their compensation composed of equity to those who have the greatest control over and visibility into the company's fortunes.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is especially important in a founder-funded or angel-funded venture, as the proportion of operating expenses derived from cash is likely to be small while expectations and entitlements are likely to be large.</p>
