<p>Some <a href="http://www.iona.com/blogs/newcomer/archives/000114.html">deep thoughts</a> from <a href="http://www.iona.com/blogs/newcomer/">Eric Newcomer</a>:</p>

<blockquote><small>The most significant innovations are over. Some would call this the "death of software." But only as we know it. Software will continue. But we are not likely to have any new languages, or see any significant new inventions. Twenty years ago no one knew what a database was, or middleware, or Java. But now I think innovation like that has stopped because IT doesn't need it any more.</small></blockquote>

<p>Maybe Eric's right.  There comes a point in any given field of inquiry where all of the questions with good ratios between effort and effect are answered, and the remaining questions are sharply partitioned into trivial or imponderable.  Knowing when a field is empty is more art than science, and the only heuristic that I can think of is when the same unsolved problems  (e.g., <a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP"><code>P</code> vs. <code>NP</code></a>) keep coming up over and over.</p>

<p>Or, maybe Eric's wrong.  Databases, message queues, and application servers are everywhere, but enterprise software and the practices that surround it <em>as a discipline</em> are at the level of stone knives and bearskins -- things are different but not necessarily any better than when the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/external-search?search-type=ss&amp;tag=pbblog-20&amp;keyword=Mythical%20Man%20Month&amp;mode=books">The Mythical Man Month</a> was written.</p>

<p>For example, there is a huge, open green field waiting for innovation in constructive approaches to model checking for distributed systems.  See <a href="http://www-cad.eecs.berkeley.edu/~rupak/blast/">BLAST</a> or <a href="http://boop.sourceforge.net/">BOOP</a> to see what's being done for straight C programs, and there are similar efforts underway for OO systems and orchestration languages like BPEL.</p>

<p>I do think Eric's right in the sense that <em>incremental</em> advances, like the database evolving out of a progression of data management libraries, are more or less at an end.  From here on out, incremental advances will provide incremental benefit.  To take a leap forward, there is a real need for software engineering, by which I mean a sort of applied computer science that fuses the discipline, depth, and rigor required to attack hard problems with the practical concerns of software at large and the savvy to spot the real problems hiding in the woodwork.</p>

<p><a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> has the vision and resources needed, as do, to a lesser extent, other majors like <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/">IBM</a> and <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/">HP</a>, but the first open problem to solve may be to find a way to marry entrepreneurship with the economic and intellectual climate to create the next kind of innovation.</p>
