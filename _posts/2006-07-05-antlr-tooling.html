<p>I've been tinkering on a little language in Java with <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> <a href="http://www.antlr.org/v3/index.html">v3</a> (still in beta, but desirable because it supports incremental parsing) as the parser generator, and so far <a href="http://www.antlr.org/works/index.html">ANTLRWorks</a> is quite convenient as an editing environment for the grammar.  (I'm also a fan and paid licensee of <a href="http://placidsystems.com/blog">Prashant Deva</a>'s very nice <a href="http://placidsystems.com/">ANTLR Studio</a> Eclipse plugin, but it only supports ANTLR v2 for the time being.)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://blog.prb.io/files/antlrworks.png" /></p>

<p>More approachable tooling for ANTLR will motivate fewer people to create XML languages, and the possibility to have out-of-the-box support for incremental parsing in a generic editing environment (e.g., Eclipse,NetBeans, IDEA, JEdit, etc.) should make writing a real parser a hands-down winner over using an XML parser and a ream of glue code as a crutch.</p>
