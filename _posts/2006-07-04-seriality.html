<p>The <a title="Employer Identification Numer">EIN</a> for &#8220;Multifarious, Inc&#8221; showed up in the mail on Monday, so I can finally get bank accounts set up, file the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f2553.pdf">2553</a> (subchapter S election) with the IRS, and finish up the initial accounting work.  This will be my second company, although it has an undefined purpose by design initially and won't ever use &#8220;multifarious&#8221; as a brand.  The company is a financial tool and a shell in which a number of different business concepts can compete, with one or more successful ideas getting spun out into their own entities.</p>
