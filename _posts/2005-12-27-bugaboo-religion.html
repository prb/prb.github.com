<p>We went east to visit Hien's side of the family this year, and that
meant traveling across a two-hop, cross-country trek with a teething
baby.  (She got her <a
href="http://ntl.matrix.com.br/pfilho/html/lyrics/a/all_i_want_for_christmas.txt">two
front teeth</a> for Christmas, among other things.)  The trip went
about as well as it possibly could have.</p>

<p>Instead of the faithful <a
href="http://www.bugaboo.nl/us/us/frog_">Frog</a>, we took one of the
standard, low-end <a
href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/b:Umbrella%20Strollers:36065484">umbrella
strollers</a> to gate check and then use during the stopovers.  I will
admit to having doubts about the Frog's <a
href="http://www.freakonomics.com/">freakonmic</a> cost-effectiveness
in comparison with the $25 umbrella stroller, but I've always
appreciated the Frog in a <a
href="http://daddytypes.com/archive/2005/02/28/wsj_weighs_in_on_dadsnstrollers.html">manly
way</a>: it's a sturdy, well-designed, well-made piece of equipment
with lots of attachments, and both Hien and Emme like it.  (Also, if
you read about the babies that other manufacturers, e.g., <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%2Bsite%3Acpsc.gov+graco">Graco</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%2Bsite%3Acpsc.gov+evenflo">Evenflo</a>,
have injured or worse, you have to think carefully about what you buy
and whom you trust.  For example, the <a
href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml01/01088.html">105
injuries from collapsing highchairs</a> was the scariest of the list
for me.)  After pushing, pulling, and otherwise manhandling the
umbrella stroller around Denver and Chicago (O'Hare) during layovers,
I truly appreciate the Frog.  (The O'Hare <a href="http://www.flychicago.com/ohare/about/about_exhibit3.shtm">Children's Museum</a> was a godsend since Emme was able to crawl around freely for an hour or so.)</p>

<p>The umbrella stroller was clearly
designed to be lightweight and to fold compactly, but it fails basic
ergonomics as a stroller.  My chief gripe is that the rear wheels are
exactly the same distance apart as my feet, so I have to walk hunched
over like Quasimodo, sashay along with one foot in line with the
other like a runway model on a catwalk, or trip over the stroller
every couple of strides.  That, and the <a
href="http://www.velonews.com/media/Block40.pdf">geometry</a> of the
<a
href="http://www.coe.uncc.edu/~gkwatkin/Dissertation/chapter2.pdf">front
end</a> and the use of a pair of wheels on each side makes the wheels
equally likely to slide sideways on a smooth surface as to spin into
alignment for forward motion.  Next time, considering that we have the
necessary accessory, we'll just schlep the Frog.</p>
