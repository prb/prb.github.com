<p>We had a good 2006, so I treated myself to an early Christmas present back in November &#8212; a 30-inch monitor as a replacement for my two 19-inch flat panels.  It's not the most cost-effective way to acquire screen real estate (e.g., 3&times;19-inch has the same number of pixels (3&times;1280&times;1024 = 3,932,160 ~ 4,096,000 = 2560&times;1600) at roughly 50% of the cost), but I got tired of looking back and forth at two monitors.  I use my eyes more than my neck with the single monitor versus the pair, so the ergonomics are better.  The taller form factor turns out to be quite convenient, since more of whatever I'm working on fits on a single screen, and because the single screen looks cluttered with a number of windows that wouldn't look cluttered with two screens, I'm more likely to limit myself to only a single application at a time, which I've found is good for my productivity.</p>
