<p>The <a href="http://www.hbr.com/">Harvard Business Review</a> published an <a href="http://harvardbusinessonline.hbsp.harvard.edu/b02/en/common/item_detail.jhtml?id=5127">article</a> from Diana Farrell called The Real New Economy that both stratifies and ties the productivity gains of the 1990's back to certain types of IT investments.</p>

<p>The thesis of the article, which is welcome from my perspective, is YMMV (your mileage may vary):</p>

<blockquote>The success of IT investment hinges on the particular practices of different industries and the particular practices of different companies. [...] For IT to fulfill its promise, users and vendors must deploy it thoughtfully, tailoring it to individual sectors and businesses and merging it with other product and process innovations.</blockquote>

<p>The most interesting quantitative observation is that retailing, securities brokerage, wholesaling, semiconductors, computer assembly, and telecommunications account for only 32% of the GDP but accounted for 76% of the net productivity gain. No surprise to those of us who poo-poo'd the bubble from start to end, securities brokerage was the only one of these six where the Internet played any role in the productivity gain. In other sectors, relative simplicity and accessibility of innovation (e.g., online banking) created a diffusion effect where any increased productivity from IT deployment was quickly matched by rivals deploying equivalent technology.</p>

<p>The (obvious) lesson is to target IT at improving the efficiency and agility of core business processes and to do so in the most exclusive and specific way. Anything else would be a waste of time and money. Here are a few suggested decision points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the technical innovation either accentuate one of my competitive advantages or cancel one of my competitive disadvantages?</li>
<li>What would prevent my competitors from trumping my investment with a similar deployment?</li>
<li>Does the technical innovation measurably increase capital output per capital input?</li>
</ul>

<p>This sort of thinking doesn't make it easy to buy technology, since there is no universally applicable return on investment computation and no way for customers and vendors to quickly identify each other, but&hellip; <em>that's the point!</em></p>
