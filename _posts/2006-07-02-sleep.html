<p>Back in January, I <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2006/01/11/ah-sleep">blogged</a> about the kid's sleeping issues, and things have suddenly and inexplicably turned the corner &#8212; last night she slept like a rock from 11:00PM until 5:30AM.  (Do rocks dream?)  The past few nights have been pretty good, too.  While we worked through getting her to sleep, we talked to plenty of people who had taken a similarly permissive stance on enforcing sleep habits, and they all said the same thing, i.e., one day you wake up in the morning and the kid will have slept through the night.  I guess that today was our day.</p>
