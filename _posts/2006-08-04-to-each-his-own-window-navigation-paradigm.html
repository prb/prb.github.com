<blockquote><small>[...] It&#8217;s only taken me a day or two to decide that the Windows/Gnome view that a window is a window is a window, and alt-tab works at a window at a time, and you don&#8217;t have to bear in mind the difference between an app an a window, is right, and OS X is wrong about this. [...]</small></blockquote>

<p>Funny.  As I've been bouncing between Linuxes, Windows, and Mac OS X, I've come to the opposite conclusion because, e.g., I can't tell from the <tt>ALT-TAB</tt> display <em>which</em> terminal window I'll get, and if I then get it wrong, I have to go through the stack of windows again and make another guess.</p>
