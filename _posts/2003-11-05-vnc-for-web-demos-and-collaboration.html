<p>At various times, we've used <a href="http://www.webex.com/">Webex</a>, <a href="http://www.centranow.com">Centra</a>, and <a href="http://www.placeware.com">Placeware</a> for on-line demos, sales meetings, and collaboration. All have their benefits (record sessions), differentiators (private network, voice over IP), and pitfalls (platform, browser version, or firewall incompatibility), but I had to kick myself a couple of days ago when a partner of ours used <a href="http://www.realvnc.com">VNC</a> to host a web demonstration: free, cross-platform, good enough web collaboration software had been staring me in the face for almost four years. (I've been using VNC for remote server management for years.)</p>

<p>So, earlier in the day, I hosted a web session for remote clients on Windows and Linux machines from my PowerBook with a simple, single-port NAT hole through our firewall and voice hosted our usual conference call system; total cost (other than the conference call) and total hassle of zero. I wish I'd thought of this a couple of years ago.</p>
