<p>Dave Rosenberg, the CEO of the recently funded MuleSource, wrote an op-ed for Sandhill.com about wrapping a business around the Mule project. (And, of course, way to go Ross! Another great project incubated at the Codehaus.) Two of Dave's comments struck a chord with me, since I'd gone over the same ground many times over the six years I spent on FiveSight.</p>

<p>On market sizing:</p>

<blockquote><small>Market data is fairly easy to find. Analyst firms such as Gartner and IDC frequently publish data that provide a base for your research. In our case we looked at the broadest market opportunity for our product over the next five years. We were able to determine that the aggregate market was $8.5 billion.</small></blockquote>

<p>Of course, looking at their track records in terms of correct predictions, you realize that folks like Gartner, Forrester, and IDC are usually wrong, and most VCs, being smart folks, know this, too. Moreover, injecting change into a market will change the size and dynamics of the market, and exerting pressure on incumbents will cause them to change their tactics. As an example, one of the things that we ran into was "red" (Oracle) or "blue" (IBM) companies where all-you-can-eat licensing combined with single-sourcing initiatives made selling into those companies impossible, and trying to back those numbers out of broad predictions was pretty much impossible without gathering new data. Selection, adoption, and installation cycles further complicate making naive estimates, and this especially true if your revenue is concentrated in one phase of the customer lifecycle (e.g., up front with training or in back with production support). Nonetheless, the market size slide with at least a $1B market is part of the obligatory small talk that's part of any funding pitch; I just have trouble doing it with a straight face.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you can attack the sizing challenge from the bottom up, and Dave hints at that &#8212; the community around the project is all of the data you need. What's the composition of your community? At what rate and under what conditions are community participants converted to customers? What products are people asking for? Part of the beauty and magic of open source is that your customers come to you, and preserving the polarity of that relationship is important. The community activity is really the first stage in the sales funnel for an open source customer, and you can choose the levers that you want to pull (evangelism, training, partnering) to alter the rate and composition of the flow. My preference would be to use this approach combined with rough market segment sizes (number of servers, etc.) to build projections. In FiveSight's case (BPEL execution component), the data told us that our product offering didn't have the breadth (e.g., full BPM platform, full ESB, full integration product) to appeal to a large market but that we could build a profitable OEM-oriented business, and that's the direction that led us to an (intended and expected) exit via acquisition.</p>

<p>On pricing:</p>

<blockquote><small>Pricing remains one of the great mysteries of any business. Open source companies tend to look at the cost of their nearest competitor and price their offering at some percentage discount.</small></blockquote>

<p>From my perspective, open source is a method of packaging and delivery of software, which if you're not selling the software, is irrelevant to pricing. Services, support, training, and access to information have the same value as they do for "proprietary" vendors, and the fine line for the open source vendor to walk is in charging for access to information while reinforcing and nurturing the community.</p>
