<p>I followed the <a href="http://publicsvn.songbirdnest.com/trac/wiki/Build_Instructions#MacOSX">instructions</a> and got <a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/">Songbird</a> built and running on my Mac without too much trouble.  (I made a couple of very minor tweaks, as I prefer <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</a> to <a href="http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/">darwinports</a>, but it is essential to get the <a href="http://www.darwinports.org/darwinports/dports/devel/glib2/Portfile">glib2</a> (2.10.3) and <a href="http://www.darwinports.org/darwinports/dports/devel/orbit2/Portfile">orbit2</a> from darwinports and in that order, as the locations of libraries are hardwired into some of the dependencies.)</p>

<p>I remain pleased with my <a href="http://blog.prb.io/a-commandline-nano-interface-for-the-slimserver.html">minimal</a> headless music configuration, but if I wanted something more iTunes-like, Songbird looks like it's going to be a good candidate.  (Maybe the Mozilla <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner">plumbing</a> will give Eclipse <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Rich_Client_Platform">RCP</a> a run for its money in the cross-platform rich client space...?)  For a pre-alpha, it's in good shape so far.  It imported most of my MP3s but turned up its beak at my <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">FLAC</a>s and <a href="http://www.vorbis.com/">Ogg</a>s even though it looks like the embedded <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> engine should <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html">support</a> them.  It will be interesting to see how plugins and some of the network and social aspects evolve; if nothing else, Javascript as an extension language is more likely to spawn a community than iTunes's <a href="http://developer.apple.com/sdk/">COM SDK</a> on Windows and <a href="http://www.dougscripts.com/itunes/itinfo/info01.php">AppleScript API</a> on OS&#160;X.</p>
