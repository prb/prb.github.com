<p>We had good traffic at the FiveSight booth in the JavaOne pavilion, and that meant that several hundred people got to hear FiveSight's elevator pitch for BPEL as the programming model for SOA and as a tool for application developers. Here's a picture from when it was quiet enough for me to step away for a few minutes:</p>

<p>(Sorry &#8212; we're completely out of hats; I didn't even get one...)</p>

<p>On this subject, I'd like to cite <a href="http://www.ebpml.org/">JJ Dubray</a>'s "elevator pitch" for BPEL:</p>

<blockquote><small>BPEL is a programming language or a set of extensions to existing programming languages that let you write programs and systems that can participate in message driven, asynchronous, long running units of work. This type of code is typically very hard to write or debug, in particular the dehydration/hydration of state, error prone, and difficult to monitor. Now that we live in a connected world, this type of code has become very common if not the norm. As such, BPEL is the programming language of SOA, it has brought consistency, order and elegance in a world of chaos. Today, BPEL can complement existing application models (e.g. J2EE) or be used for EAI applications, for web service compositions and in the near future it will become a key technology of BPM along with choreography languages.</small></blockquote>

<p>This was inspired by my post from <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2004/06/18/dog-art-and-what-you-tell-your-mom">2004-06-18</a>, and while it's still not simple and direct enough to convince my mom that BPEL is going to be something big, the resonance with technologists and developers on the pavilion floor was unmistakable.</p>
