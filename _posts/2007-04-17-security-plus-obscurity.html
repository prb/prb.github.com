<p>I've been getting a new bank account set up for use on-line, and for security, Bank of America's process is to send an initial password through the mail.  Here's what they sent:</p>

<p>So, is that last character a one, a lowercase ell, a capital ell, or a pipe?  (And, for that matter, what about people who are visually impaired?)  Maybe a little more thought about the font is warranted.  After getting a "our system is down, try again later" error while trying the possibilities, I tried again later only to be told that I'd exhausted my guesses.  So I called them for assistance, as instructed, and once I'd navigated through several nodes of IVR menus, I was connected to a "Your call cannot be completed as dialed..." message.</p>

<p>I'll point out that it would be simpler (and $0.30 cheaper) to assign a password to or collect a password from people as they open their accounts.</p>

<p>Time for a new bank.</p>
