<p>After experiments with Microsoft Word and DocBook (both of which turned out to be poor choices but for different reasons), we're using the <a href="http://atlassian.com/confluence/">Confluence</a> wiki for the documentation for <a href="http://www.fivesight.com/pxe.shtml">PXE</a>, and I've been enjoying <a href="http://timtam.codehaus.org/">TimTam</a> instead of a browser-based client.</p>

<p>Named for the tasty <a href="http://www.simplyoz.com/products/aussie_food/biscuits/tim_tams">cookie</a> from Oz that can be used as a straw, TimTam is an <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>-based thick client (a "thiki", as I would call it) for Confluence with a useful interface -- left-hand tree for wiki pages and a normal-sized window with reasonable key bindings, content-assist for macros, and a source/preview dual view for editing content.  TimTam's still pre-1.0, but the tip builds and works well on Mac OS X with Eclipse 3.1M5a.</p>
