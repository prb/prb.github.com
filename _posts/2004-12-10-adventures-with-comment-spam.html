<p>While it was a trickle at first, comment spam ramped up to 100+ per day in the past couple of weeks, so I bit the bullet and learned how to install <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> plugins.  That may not sound like such a big deal, but I don't know <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and have absolutely no desire to learn.  In fact, I have so little desire to learn PHP that I thought briefly about switching to <a href="http://newsbruiser.tigris.org/">NewsBruiser</a> (which is written in <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, a language I know, and offers a bayesian filter for comments) or even <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> (which is written in <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">Perl</a>, a language I used to know), but in the end, suffering a little PHP was more palatable than the thought of migrating content, proxying permalinks, and learning yet another weblog server.</p>

<p>All in all, it turns out to be trivial &#8212; there is a WordPress "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a>" plugin called "<a href="http://www.gudlyf.com/archives/2004/06/07/wordpress-hack-authimage/">authimage</a>" that does the job.  Even though I had to make some simple changes, installing it took all of 20 minutes, including installing a couple of necessary <a href="http://www.debian.org/">debian</a> packages -- and I still don't know PHP.</p>
