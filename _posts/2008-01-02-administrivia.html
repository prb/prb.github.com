<p>I've switched my publishing engine from Typo to a home-brew
platform called "perpubplat" which appears to be stable enough (i.e.,
better than Typo) but will remain a work in progress.  (I'll post more
on perpubplat later; I'm happy to share source code with folks and
will post <a href="http://darcs.net/">Darcs</a> repository information
once I've cleaned things up a bit.)</p>

<p>Of relevance to feed subscribers (and perhaps how you ended up
here):</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">RSS</a> feeds
are no longer provided in any form.  What would have been a request
for an RSS feed directs to an Atom feed containing this post.</li>

<li>As a corollary of the non-existence of RSS, <a
href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltcategorygtSubelementOfLtitemgt">categories</a>
(as semantic artifacts of RSS) no longer exist.  Instead, you can pick
out a relevant by-tag feed, e.g., for posts tagged <a
href="http://mult.ifario.us/t/haskell">Haskell</a>, <a
href="http://mult.ifario.us/t/java">Java</a>, or <a
href="http://mult.ifario.us/t/entrepreneurship">entrepreneurship</a>.
(For any by-tag or by-date view, there is an associated feed available
via <a
href="http://philringnalda.com/rfc/draft-ietf-atompub-autodiscovery-01.html">autodiscovery</a>.)</li>

<li>Comment feeds by article internal identifier are no longer
supported.  (Comment feeds by article are supported with a different,
permatitle-based URI; check the autodiscovery links on a single
article page.)</li>

</ul>

<p>Of relevance to visitors:</p>

<ul>

<li>For the time being, new comments aren't supported directly on this
blog, but that shouldn't stop you from commenting on your own blog or
posting to a community site like <a
href="http://programming.reddit.com">Reddit</a> or <a
href="http://www.dzone.com/links/">DZone</a>.  The plumbing for
comments (as well as trackbacks and backreferences) is present, but I haven't decided how I want to restrict
content and control spam yet.  Historical comments and trackbacks
are present.</li>

<li>I've made some effort (i.e., using <a
href="http://feedvalidator.org/">FeedValidator</a> and <a
href="http://www.xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html"><code>xmllint</code></a>)
to ensure that specification compliance is provided when advertised,
including cleaning up the content of older posts, but please <a
href="mailto:paulrbrown@gmail.com">let me know</a> if something falls
short.</li>

</ul>
