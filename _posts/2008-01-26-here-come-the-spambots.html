<p>It didn't take long for someone (or something) to send the first
comment spam:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img

<p>It's interesting in that the spambot appears to choose the same
pages as on other blogs and that either someone wrote a quick plugin
for their spambot platform or has a bot that figures out what links
and form fields mean.</p>
