<p>(The <a href="http://slideaware.com/">SlideAware</a> guys <a href="http://slideaware.typepad.com/slideaware/2007/05/there_is_a_worl.html">obviously</a> have a different perspective.)  As I've been bouncing around between languages for various projects (Java, Ruby, Erlang, Haskell, etc.), the only thing I've found that really makes me want to wield a fork or other sharp implement is what people <em>do</em> with the language as opposed to the language itself. </p>
