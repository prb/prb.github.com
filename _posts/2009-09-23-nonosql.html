<p><a href="http://blog.b3k.us/">Ben Black</a>, one of the organizers
of <a href="http://nosqleast.com/"><code>no:sql(east).</code></a>
conference, <a
href="http://twitter.com/benjaminblack/status/4296043561">tweeted</a>,
and I twote:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="my current vote for renaming #nosql is #altdb. what are your ideas?" src="http://mult.ifario.us/images/bbtweetnosqlaltdb.png" /></p>

<p>Chris Williams, another <code>no:sql(east).</code> organizer, has had <a
href="http://voodootikigod.com/nosql-a-modest-proposal">similar
sentiments</a>, but what really needs to happen is for people to stop
using the "NoSQL" term.  I originally <a
href="http://twitter.com/paulrbrown/status/3847403891">proposed</a>
"dbng" for next-generation database (and with an intended allusion to
<a href="http://www.relaxng.org/">RELAX NG</a>), but I'm warming up to
Ben Black's suggestion of "altdb" for the hint of Usenet <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt.*_hierarchy">alt.*</a> if
nothing else.</p>

<p>I propose a new movement called the <em>NoNoSQL</em> movement.  It
is a movement for those interested in alternative and next-generation
databases but not in the inaccurate "NoSQL" neologism.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://mult.ifario.us/images/nonosql.png" /></p>

<p>Seems like some cool altdb schwag (t-shirts, mugs, etc.) is in
order &#8212; "Not your daddy's database." or "Joiners need not apply." or...</p>
