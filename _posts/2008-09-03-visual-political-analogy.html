<p>Reading some coverage of the Republicon convention and seeing pictures of Bush on the big screen brought to mind the classic Apple 1984 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYecfV3ubP8">ad</a>, and the following visual analogy is obvious:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://mult.ifario.us/files/big_bush.png" alt="bush:big_brother::obama:hammer_thrower" /></p>

<p>For what it's worth, I've never felt much of an affinity for either
party, and while I voted American last election (i.e., against Bush),
I can understand how people might identify with what Bush
<em>said</em>.  I just can't understand how anyone could support what
he <em>did</em>.</p>
