<p><a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/">Reg Braithwaite</a> has lots of smart things to say, and I agree about asking potentially <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2007/01/interesting-case-of-bias.html">challenging questions</a> in an interview, albeit for different reasons.  When hiring someone who represents themselves as "senior", the ultimate answer is simpler:  I have 60-90 minutes to figure out who you are and what "senior" means; you have 60-90 minutes to help me, so get cracking.  Whining about the question during or after completely misses the point.</p>
