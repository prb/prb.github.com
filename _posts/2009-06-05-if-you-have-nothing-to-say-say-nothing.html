<p>There is never a good reason to announce that you're going to make
an announcement.  This rule came to mind when I saw this tweet scroll
by this morning:</p>
 
<p style="text-align:center"><img
src="http://blog.prb.io/files/nonannouncement.jpg" alt="[screenshot of tweet]" /></p>

<p>This belongs in the same category of non-actions as a blog post to
say you haven't been blogging, telling people about your "stealth"
startup, or a statement like "with all due respect".</p>
