<p>An <a href="http://www.internetnews.com">internetnews.com</a> <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3490091">article</a> on IBM's <a href="http://www.ascential.com/news/ibm.html">acquisition</a> of Ascential had an interesting comment from Ron Schmelzer:</p><blockquote><small>"[...] I think we're seeing just the beginning of consolidation in this space. I would expect to see more around process, management, security, event-driven capabilities, policy and performance. [This year] will be a big year for consolidation. The question remains: is there room for start ups?"</small></blockquote><p>Consolidation in integration is making room for startup ventures, although not necessarily in integration as such.  The bigger the animal, the bigger the meals and the bigger the, um..., poops; any or all of these may make a fertile habitat for some new creatures.  Hopefully, this is the genesis of all kinds of interesting critters that couldn't have existed otherwise.</p>
