<p>You know it's a serious storm when the National Weather Service <a href="http://www.uswx.com/spi/wx/wa/UHWS.9239/">says</a> things like:</p>

<blockquote><small><tt>THE HIGH WINDS WILL CAUSE FALLING TREES AND POWER LINES. POWER OUTAGES ARE LIKELY TO BE EXTENSIVE. DAMAGE TO STRUCTURES IS POSSIBLE AND FLYING DEBRIS WILL BE A HAZARD. DEATHS AND INJURIES FROM THIS TYPE OF WIND STORM TYPICALLY OCCUR AS A RESULT OF TREES FALLING ON CARS AND SOMETIMES ON HOUSES. PEOPLE SHOULD AVOID BEING ON THE ROAD OVERNIGHT AND SHOULD SEEK SHELTER IN A STURDY BUILDING AWAY FROM WEAK TREES.</tt></small></blockquote>
