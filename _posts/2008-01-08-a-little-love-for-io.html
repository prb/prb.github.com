<p><a href="http://iolanguage.com">Io</a> has been getting some <a

<a

lately for its reflection capabilities and minimality.  Steve
Dekorte's <a href="http://www.dekorte.com/blog/">blog</a> is also a
good read, although software wisdom is vastly outnumbered by links to
<a

<a

and <a
href="http://www.dekorte.com/blog/blog.cgi?do=item&amp;id=3139">design</a>.</p>

<p>My favorite thing about the language is still its concurrency
annotations.  Way back in 2004, when I was surveying <a
href="http://www.erights.org/history/actors.html">Actor</a> languages,
I <a
href="http://mult.ifario.us/p/a-little-fun-with-concurrency-in-io">posted</a>
about Io's support for making methods non-blocking via annotating the
invocation.  (This is similar to Haskell's <code>par</code> <a
href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/parallel/Control-Parallel.html#v%3Apar">annotation</a>.)
Other than <code>activeCoroCount</code> being replaced by
<code>activeActorCount</code>, it looks like the annotations remain
the same:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>foo bar</code> calls the <code>bar</code> method on the object <code>foo</code> synchronously, returning a value.</li>
<li><code>foo @bar</code> calls the method asynchronously, immediately returning a future.</li>
<li><code>foo @@bar</code> calls the method asynchronously, immediately returning <code>nil</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I haven't had a chance to try out the deadlock detection, but
coming up with an example should be an interesting exercise.</p>
