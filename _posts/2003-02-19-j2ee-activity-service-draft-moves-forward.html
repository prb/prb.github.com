<p>I'm going to try to get some regular coverage for the politics behind the various specifications floating around the long-running transaction space (specifically as related to web services) as well as a good set of background, and a recent <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=1575">Community Draft Ballot</a> for <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=95">JSR95: J2EE Activity Service for Extended Transactions</a> &#8212; with participation from <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a>, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>, <a href="http://www.sap.com">SAP</a>, and <a href="http://www.bea.com">BEA</a> &#8212; fits both bills.</p>

<p>SAP's comments were particularly telling:</p>

<blockquote>The proposal has the potential of conflicting with alternative solutions that are proposed as part of J2EE (e.g. loosely coupled Web services) and therefore the architectural integrity of J2EE could potentially be affected.</blockquote>

<p>With the other commenting party being BEA, who simply said:</p>

<blockquote>[Yes] Reluctlantly, since we still believe this is premature.</blockquote>

<p>It may be premature, but the original JSR was planned for release in 3Q2001... Obtaining a copy of the specification is still an open item.</p>
