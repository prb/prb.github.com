<p>I was cleaning up some <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chanterelle">Chanterelle</a>
mushrooms (bought from <a
href="http://localfoods.about.com/od/growersartisans/p/jeremy_faber.htm">this
guy</a>) for dinner tonight when a tiny bug perched on one of the caps
caught my attention.  On closer inspection, it looked like a tiny
scorpion barely a few millimeters long, sans tail.  Considering its
size, I was amused when it took an aggressive posture and waved its
tiny claws at me as if to say "You want a piece of me?"  Since we
switched over to doing most of our non-meat shopping at the local
farmer's market, I'm accustomed to finding insects and arachnids in
our produce (sure beats eating poisoned food...), but this one was
unlike anything else I'd run into.  This picture (generously CC 2.0 <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/deed.en">by-nc-nd</a> licensed by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/amanky/">amanky</a> on Flickr) gives a sense for
the appearance and size:</p>

<p>It turns out that there are a whole order of these little arachnids
called <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscorpion">pseudoscorpions</a>,
and they're common in leaf litter (which is where the mushrooms grow),
among other places.  The thing that I think is oddest is that I spent
a good portion of my childhood knocking around the Pacific Northwest
backwoods and never noticed one before now.</p>

<p>I tried to keep the little guy (or gal?) around in Kid#1's plastic
bug jar, but by the time I was done cooking dinner, it had found its
way out through one of the air holes.  The mushrooms were delicious at
any rate.</p>
