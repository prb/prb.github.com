<p>As a follow-up to my last <a
href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2007/08/10/imovie-and-hdr-sr1-headaches">post</a>
about iMovie '08's "support" for AVCHD, I've now got a usable workflow
on my G5.</p>

<p>First up, the AVCHD clips are on the order of 5x-10x
<em>smaller</em> than the transcoded versions, so it makes sense to
store the original AVCHD clips and only transcode for the purpose of
editing and assembling a larger clip.</p>

<p>Second, a <a href="http://mac1080hd.com/">couple of guys</a> have
done the work of wrapping <a
href="http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/">FFmpeg</a> up as a MacOS
application ("Voltaic", shareware, $30), and the transcoded clips work
just fine with iMovie '08.  (I haven't done a careful comparison of
clips transcoded with iMovie and Voltaic, but the results with Voltaic
look acceptable so far.)</p>
