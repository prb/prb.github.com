<p>I've been a fan and user of Atlassian's excellent <a
href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">Jira</a> since the
company was founded back in 2002, but I needed the ability to set up
some quick-hit bug/task/wiki sites for smaller consulting projects and
neither the month-to-month hosted model nor the enterprise license
made good economic sense.  I opted for the an install of <a
href="http://www.redmine.org/">Redmine</a>, and while it's no Jira,
I've been reasonably happy with it.  (The one big headache was getting
SMTP over TLS working.)</p>

<p>Redmine supports integration with <a
href="http://www.git-scm.org/">Git</a> repositories on a per-project
basis and will link commits to issues based on the presence of
keywords and issue identifiers (e.g., "<code>refs #123</code>").  The
way the integration is implemented works well if the Git repository is
hosted on the same machine as the Remine instance, but I host all
customer and internal work on <a href="http://github.com">github</a>.
Here's a quick recipe to bridge the gap.</p>

<p>First, add an ssh key for the <code>redmine</code> user to your
github account.</p>

<p>Next, create a home for the following shell script, e.g.,
<code>/opt/redmine_extras/bin</code> and a home for Git repositories
on the server, e.g., <code>/var/redmine/git_repositories</code> and
ensure that the <code>redmine</code> user has write privileges for the
repositories.  Here's the <code>pull_git</code> script:</p>

<pre class="code">#!/bin/bash
export REPOS=/var/redmine/git_repositories
export REDMINE_HOME=/opt/redmine-0.8.2
export LOGFILE=/var/log/redmine_extras.log

function log_prefix {
        echo -n `date '+%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S'`" ["$$"] ${2}"
}

for i in `ls -d ${REPOS}/*.git`; do 
  cd $i;
  log_prefix &amp;&amp; echo 'Processing git repository from '${i}'...';
  /usr/local/bin/git --bare fetch origin :master
done

cd ${REDMINE_HOME}
log_prefix &amp;&amp; echo 'Updating Redmine...'
/usr/local/bin/ruby script/runner "Repository.fetch_changesets" -e production</pre>

<p>Then (I'm logged in as <code>root</code>) add the command to the
<code>redmine</code> user's crontab:</p>

<pre class="code"># echo '*/10 * * * *    /opt/redmine_extras/bin/pull_git 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;&gt; /var/log/redmine_extras.log'\
 | crontab -u redmine -</pre>

<p>Now, for each repository, say <code>foo</code> and your github user
is <code>bar</code>, you will track from Redmine, do:</p>

<pre class="code"># cd /var/redmine/git_repositories
# sudo -u redmine -H git clone --bare git@github.com:bar/foo.git
# cd foo.git
# sudo -u redmine -H git --bare remote add origin git@github:bar/foo.git</pre>

<p>Ensure that the Redmine project points to the local copy of the
Git repository, and the revisions should start getting syncronized
every ten minutes.</p>
