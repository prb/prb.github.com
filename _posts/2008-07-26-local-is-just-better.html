<p>Via <a href="http://fnokd.com">Bob</a>'s <a
href="http://foodjaunt.com/">FoodJaunt</a> social portal (at least that's
what I'd call it) and younger sister to <a
href="http://greenthumbr.com/">Greenthumbr</a>, I found an NYT <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/22/dining/22local.html?ex=1374465600&amp;en=5ea9bfd45d9e20d6&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink">article</a>
(compare <a
href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/23/MN8R118AR4.DTL">article</a>
at SFGate) about a gardener-for-hire who will plant and tend a garden
in your yard, and the idea of a decentralized urban farm is
compelling.</p>

<p>One paragraph in the NYT article misses the point:</p>

<blockquote><p>Although a completely local diet is out of reach for
even the most dedicated, the shift toward it is being driven by the
increasingly popular view that fast food is the enemy and that local
food tastes better. Depending on the season, local produce can cost an
additional $1 a pound or more. But long-distance food, with its
attendant petroleum consumption and cheap wages, is harming the planet
and does nothing to help build communities, locavores
believe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Local isn't just better for the planet. <em>Local is just
better.</em></p>

<p>For example, one facet of better is fresher. The lettuce we buy at
the local <a
href="http://www.seattlefarmersmarkets.org/markets/u_district">farmer's
market</a> (usually from "Let Us Farm") travels the 100-ish miles
(Google Maps routing says 99.8 miles &#8212; "local" it is!) from the
field to my fridge in under 24 hours if not under eight hours, and it
stays edible for a week or more. For comparison, a smaller head of
butter lettuce from Whole Foods, entombed in its keep sake plastic
clamshell, keeps at most a few days once brought home from the store
just because of the additional handling and time elapsed. Moreover,
the local lettuce <em>costs less</em>. When presented with the
apples-to-apples comparison, even the crassest consumer would choose
the local option.</p>

<p>As energy costs increase, decentralized production and distribution
should result in lower prices, higher quality, and more variety. The
irresistible force of fundamental economic self-interest is going to
drive change in our food supply chain, not something more noble or
farsighted. That's a good thing, too, because relatively few people
have a sense of duty to the collective good, but everyone has a
wallet.</p>
