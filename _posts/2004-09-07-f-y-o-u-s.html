<p>Oracle makes a nice enough database, but the Oracle Ultra Search robot is a bandwidth pig that got on my nerves enough to block it.  By precentage, it accounts for 10% of the traffic and 25% of the bandwidth for the *.fivesight.com web servers and typically gathers content with several parallel threads.  You'd think it would be easy enough for the robot to support <a href="http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers">conditional GET</a>, but since it doesn't, an HTTP 403 and exclusion in <code>robots.txt</code> are my version of FYO in response to the uninvited load test from Oracle's <a href="http://www.oracleads.com">demonstration server</a>.  (For comparison, Google's crawler <em>does</em> support conditional GET for at least PDF files.)</p>

<p>(For the uninitiated, here's an <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/07/05/EvilIBM">explanation</a> of "FYO".)</p>
