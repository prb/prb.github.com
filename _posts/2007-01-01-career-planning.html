<p><a href="http://www.addsimplicity.com/adding_simplicity_an_engi/">Dan Pritchett</a>'s <a href="http://www.addsimplicity.com/adding_simplicity_an_engi/2006/12/how_not_to_plan.html">post</a> about his career path reminded me of my experience with the academic job market back in 1997.  I sent out seven applications and ended up with a good job at <a href="http://www.math.uic.edu">UIC</a>, one of a few places (<a href="http://www.math.cornell.edu">Cornell</a>, <a href="http://www.math.utah.edu/">University of Utah</a>) with a good number of people who worked in areas closely related to my dissertation research; to put things in perspective, I was one of ~900 applicants for the position at UIC.</p>

<p>Before sending out applications, I asked my Ph.D. advisor about his experience on the job market.  As he was finishing up his dissertation, his advisor asked if he'd like a job at Princeton.  He said, "OK", and that was that.  Of course, that was the 1960s...  I also talked with my undergraduate academic advisor, and he ended up with five job offers &#8212; from three applications, i.e., two <em>unsolicited</em> job offers.  Of course, that was the 1950s...  Different decades brought different experiences; the mid-1970s were as rough as if not rougher than the late 1990s, and the 1980s were better (but not like the 1950s or 1960s).  It takes a little doing to work it out, but the collective fortunes of generations of academic mathematicians boil down to how the academic organism responds to macro-level sociopolitical stimuli like the Baby Boom or the Cold War.  This is just an anecdotal argument that one kind of prediction is as difficult as another.</p>

<p>As for planning (&ne; prediction), the key is neither to be too specific in your goals nor to expect that being good at something means that people will pay handsomely for you to do it.  I do have one piece of specific advice: don't use predictions to do planning; predictions, by nature, are usually wrong.</p>
