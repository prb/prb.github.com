<p>Manning the <a href="http://www.envoisolutions.com">Envoi Solutions</a> booth at JavaOne with Dan was a good time.  The overall win from the show was getting to talk to lots of people who are happy users of the <a href="http://xfire.codehaus.org/">XFire</a> project at the <a href="http://www.codehaus.org">Codehaus</a>.  The unfortunate thing was that not many of them were aware that XFire has <a href="http://xfire.codehaus.org/XFire+and+Celtix+Merge">evolved</a> into <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/cxf/">CXF</a>, a project under <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">incubation</a> at Apache and rolling up to a 2.0 release, and even fewer of them were aware that Envoi Solutions was the company founded by the same guy who founded the XFire project, i.e., <a href="http://netzooid.com/blog/">Dan</a>.  In an open source project, especially a project that's got relatively low barriers to entry and few major issues, you don't get many opportunities to touch your customer, and it's poor etiquette to make the first move &#8212; the download and evaluation process should be frictionless and as anonymous as possible.  You're stuck waiting for the customer to touch you first, and they may not even know you're there.</p>

<p>One place to attack the anonymity issue is at the point of distribution, and done right, this doesn't need to taint the community or the company.  Introducing a level of indirection should be an obvious trick for a software developer, and the idea is the same classic that the various Linux companies have been using for a long time &#8212; distribute a slightly more polished or otherwise augmented version through a channel that's separate from the project, and use that indirection to associate the distribution with the company.  Some of the goodies that Dan's got underway (some private as yet and some public, e.g., <a href="http://sxc.codehaus.org/JAXB">SXC</a>) should help create that level of indirection.</p>

<p>The negative from the conference was the pavilion layout.  The Envoi booth was in the "startup exhibitor alley", and like many things, it sounded like a good idea at the time.  The floor layout showed the alley as a rectangular placeholder, but the actual layout was a bunch of angled walls spaced about eight feet apart with one vendor assigned to the front and back of each wall.  The vendors on the ends had a great deal, but the vendors in the middle essentially shared a narrow strip of floor space and had to generate traffic by tackling passers-by.  (Nonetheless, we were in good company, sandwiched between <a href="http://www.talend.com">Talend</a> and <a href="http://www.hyperic.com/">Hyperic</a>.)  The conference representative was impressively unapologetic.  Not quite verbatim, but close: "If you choose to come next year, you won't be eligible for the startup alley, so you'd be in one of the booths on the floor.  This was just something we tried, and we'll do it differently next year."  Caveat exhibitor...</p>
