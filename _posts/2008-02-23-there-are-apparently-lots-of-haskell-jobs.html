<p>... and some of them even involve trees.</p>

<p>A while ago, Rod Johnson <a
href="http://blog.springsource.com/main/2008/01/23/spring-overtakes-ejb-as-a-skills-requirement/">asserted</a>
that Spring had overtaken EJB as a job requirement for Java
developers, supported by some <a
href="http://www.indeed.com/jobtrends">charts</a> from <a
href="http://www.indeed.com">indeed.com</a>.  (For follow-on analysis,
see an <a
href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/ejb-spring-job-listings-trends">article</a>
on InfoQ.)  I'd call the Spring or EJB decision a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma">false dichotomy</a>
in any case.</p>

<p>On a lark, I decided to try a three-way competition between
Haskell, Erlang, and OCaml, with Lisp and Pascal thrown in just
because, and the results surprised me, since I expected Erlang to beat
both Haskell and OCaml:</p>

<p>So, what are these Haskell jobs...?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="haskell job listings" src="http://mult.ifario.us/files/haskell-job-listings.png" /></p>

<p>Ah.  A more reasonable query (like <a
href="http://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=haskell+and+functional">"haskell
and functional"</a>) gives the expected results of a few jobs in
financial services.  The most intersting thing about the query is that
twelve jobs is about 0.00025% of the total number of jobs in the
engine, so I'll guess that they have on the order of 4.8 million jobs
and thus that there are around 9,600 jobs (0.2%) listed for "spring
and java" as requirements.</p>
