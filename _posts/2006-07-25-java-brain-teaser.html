<p>This one is only of moderate difficulty, but it's still worth a mention (since I stumbled across it today debugging someone else's code).  What could go wrong with the following Java code?</p>

<pre class="code">try {
  [code]
} catch (Exception  e) {
  throw new RuntimeException(e);
} finally {
  [code]
}</pre>
