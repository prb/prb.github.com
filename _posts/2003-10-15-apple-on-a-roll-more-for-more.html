<p>According to <a href="http://maccentral.macworld.com/news/2003/10/15/units/">MacCentral</a>, it looks like <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> is on a roll:

<blockquote>With refreshed PowerBook G4s across the line, including the long-awaited update to Apple's popular 15-inch PowerBook G4 model, the company saw 9 percent sequential growth and 203 percent year over year growth in PowerBook sales, totally 176,000 units for the quarter and $348 million in revenue.</blockquote>

<p>This looks especially good in the face of a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3196266.stm">15% number</a> year-to-year number for generic PCs from <a href="http://www.idc.com">IDC</a> and <a href="http://www.gartner.com">Gartner</a>.  (The <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/holes/story/0,10801,86099,00.html?f=x10">current situation</a> with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows">Windows</a> doesn't make me doubt the switch to a PowerBook; see <a href="http://blogs.fivesight.com/pbblog/index.php?p=89">Made the Move to Mac</a>.)</p>

<p>It's interesting to consider the reasons behind Apple's success. From my perspective, that success is due to a more for more positioning on the cartesian grid of less, same, and more product for price, and this is arguably the best way to build a niche business in an otherwise crowded space. The challenge, which Apple has met artfully, is how to convincingly deliver that more to the customer. </p></p>
