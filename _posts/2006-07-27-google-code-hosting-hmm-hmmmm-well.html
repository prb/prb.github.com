<p>As a consumer/producer of open source, it was interesting to see <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Code</a> <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/">hosting</a> launch today.  It also explains why people from Google were trolling with questions about how Google could help open source...  (I should have asked for a <a href="http://www.google.com/enterprise/gsa/">search appliance</a> for the <a href="http://www.codehaus.org">Haus</a> now that I'm thinking about it.)  It's pleasantly minimal in that it fits cleanly into the spectrum of available infrastructure below the level of a <a href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>, <a href="http://rubyforge.org/">RubyForge</a>, or <a href="http://community.java.net/projects/">Java.net</a>: no mailing lists, no forums, no releases, and no project entry criteria &#8212; just fill-in a <a href="http://code.google.com/hosting/createProject">form</a> to get 100Mb of subversion space and an ultralight bugtracker.</p>

<p>From a producer perspective, no strings attached, free subversion hosting is a great offering, although I'd be more likely to use something private and something cooler than subversion &#8212; like <a href="http://abridgegame.org/darcs/">darcs</a> or <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> or another system that supports both push and pull branching semantics &#8212; until and even after a project is ready for public consumption.  (Subversion+<a href="http://svk.elixus.org/">svk</a> would count.)  As a consumer, my question is how I'm going to filter out the crap.  Nothing is worse than seeing a promising-sounding project and then finding out that there's nothing of value there.  On SourceForge, there's plenty of deadwood, but I can look for releases, at activity levels on mailing lists, or at project statistics.  On Java.net, I can look at releases, mailing lists, or at <a href="http://community.java.net/projects/top.csp">rankings</a>.  A good start on a crap filter would be a simple voting model for projects, e.g., allow a user to leave a star on a project that they found actually useful.  (Of course, something like the <a href="http://finance.google.com">Google Finance</a> plotting widget applied to subversion activity and branches/tags wouldn't hurt, either.)</p>

<p>My answer to the &#8220;How could Google help open source?&#8221; at the time was straightforward: contribute effort and even sponsorship to the projects that Google developers find useful.  This is what everyone does (or at least what everyone is <em>supposed</em> to do).  Barriers to entry have never been an issue for open source projects, but drawing together a community and channeling combined energy into defining and creating good software have always been and remains a challenge.</p>
