<p>As she's approaching her third birthday, the kid is showing signs of
a sense of humor.  We were in the car with the kid, discussing what to
have for dinner, and my wife told her that we were
going to have lamb, peas, and couscous.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>kid:</em> Dad, would you like some hotto-potaddo for dinner?</p>
<p><em>dad:</em> [Decides to play along.]  Sure; that sounds good.</p>
<p><em>kid:</em> Would you like some hotto-potaddo for dinner, Mom?</p>
<p><em>mom:</em> [Decides to play along, too.]  OK.</p>
<p><em>kid:</em> Hotto-potaddo for you, Dad, and hotto-potaddo for you, Mom.  I will have lamb and peas myself.</p></blockquote>

<p>I wonder where she learns this stuff.</p>
