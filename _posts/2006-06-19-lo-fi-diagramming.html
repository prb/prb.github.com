<p>When I was a mathematician, my preferred tools were a hard-bound notebook, a rollerball pen, and a box of crayons.  I drew tons of pictures to help myself make sense of my ideas, and when I needed one for a document, I'd spend some time and draw it up in Adobe Illustrator or write a program in a T<sub>E</sub>X macro package to draw it.  I've written other entries about why as-plain-as-possible text files are preferable to formatted documents in a system like Microsoft Word or Open Office, and the same applies to drawings, except that in this case, it involves not using a computer at all.</p>

<p>A piece of paper or pieces of paper, fed into a fax machine and then received via <a href="http://www.jConnect.com">j2</a> (or <a href="http://www.efax.com">eFax</a> or another similar service) or scanned with a multifunction machine and converted to a convenient format (i.e., PDF), are more time-effective than a drawing tool like Visio or even OmniGraffle.  It takes a few minutes to sketch out what's needed, drop it in a sheet feeder, and then collect the results for use as an email attachment or for cut-and-paste.  (At least on the Mac, Preview supports cut-and-paste to other applications as <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/pdf/">native PDF</a>.)  For a related take, see <a href="http://www.infodesign.com.au/usabilityresources/design/paperprototypinggraphics.asp">Paper Prototyping Graphics</a>, although the idea of using stickers seems like a step back toward unnecessary frills to me.</p>

<p>In the form of a &#8220;do the simplest thing&#8221; corollary: <em>If you need to draw a picture, use a pen.  If you need to draw a pretty picture, use an app.</em></p>
