<p>Earlier in the week, I received an email from <a href="http://www.ancestry.com">Ancestry.com</a> informing me of how to change my password.  This was of interest, since I'd never signed up on their site or even heard of them, and the company at least looks reputable enough that I doubt that they're artificially boosting their membership stats by shanghaiing people with guessable gmail addresses.</p>

<p>I poked around enough to find out how to turn off their marketing spam, but what I really want is a way to say "delete me" &#8212; remove any and all records of my personal information (including otherwise innocuous information like name and email address).  Every app should have that functionality, but very few do.</p>
