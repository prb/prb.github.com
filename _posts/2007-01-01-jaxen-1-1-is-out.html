<p><a href="http://jaxen.org/">Jaxen</a>, the ubiquitous Java XPath 1.0 library that has been in beta since (2002?) before it was cool to be in beta, finally got its 1.1 release, thanks in large part to the efforts of <a href="http://www.elharo.com/">Elliotte Rusty Harold</a> to clean up compliance issues and other bugs.  Thanks, ERH!</p>
