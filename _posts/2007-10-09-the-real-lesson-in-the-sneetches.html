<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sneetches_and_Other_Stories">The Sneetches</a> is the kid's superfavorite book right now, and I've read it at least twice per bedtime (excepting the story about the two Zaxes and the bit about 23 Daves) every night for the past week.  The obvious message in the book is about superficial differences and tolerance.</p>

<p>Call me cynical or jaded from doing a tour of duty as an entrepreneur, but I see another message in the book:</p>

<blockquote>Stars, schmars.  You want to be Sylvester McMonkey McBean.</blockquote>
