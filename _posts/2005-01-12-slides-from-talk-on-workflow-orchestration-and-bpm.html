<p>Last year, I had an opportunity to give a keynote on BPM and workflow at <a href="http://www.lmco.com">Lockheed-Martin</a>'s annual conference, and some of the recent buzz (like posts from <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2005/01/ant_workflow_orchestration.html">Bill</a>, <a href="http://smartcomps.kgbinternet.com/confluence/display/twister/2005/01/12/These+things+called+Workflow+and+Orchestration">Matthieu</a>, and earlier on from <a href="http://www.jbpm.org/state.of.workflow.html">Tom</a>) around workflow and orchestration has reminded me to get my slides posted on-line.</p>

<p>So, <a href="http://www.fivesight.com/downloads/piwflowbpm.pdf">here</a> they are.</p>
