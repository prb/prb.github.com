<p><a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a> recently had <a href="http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0302.2/1909.html">a few words</a> to say about Intel's <a href="http://www.intel.com/products/server/processors/server/itanium2/index.htm?iid=ipp_srvr_proc+high1_080702&amp;">Itanium2</a> chip:</p>

<blockquote>IA64 made all the mistakes anybody else did, and threw out all the good parts of the x86 because people thought those parts were ugly. They aren't ugly, they're the "charming oddity" that makes it do well.</blockquote>

<p>Given his <a href="http://www.transmeta.com/">affiliations</a>, this will surely provoke <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=7966">some discussion</a>, but he touches on the converse of an interesting point.</p>

<p>Dealing with "ugly" issues has to happen somewhere in the stack of hardware and software that separates user and electrons, and just where that happens makes a real difference. The same thing goes for steps in a business process, composition of layers in software architecture, and even interpersonal interactions. Order of operations and decomposition can and often do make the difference between an elegant solution and an unworkable situation.</p>
