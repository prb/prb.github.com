<p>I've moved the venerable <a
href="http://blogs.fivesight.com/pbblog">pbblog</a> over to <a
href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/">typo</a> on <a
href="http://www.lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a> (and renamed it <a
href="http://.dictionary.reference.com/search?q=multifarious">mult.ifario.us</a>),
and the experience has been pleasant so far.  (Thanks to <a
href="http://weblog.0x7b.com/">Joseph Tam</a> for helpful how-to
articles <a
href="http://weblog.0x7b.com/articles/2005/09/17/lighttpd-setup-on-textdrive-com">here</a>
and <a
href="http://weblog.0x7b.com/articles/2005/09/17/lighttpd-setup-on-textdrive-com-part-ii">here</a>.)</p>

<p>The subject matter should stay mostly the same, i.e., whatever I
feel like posting.  As for migrating away from <a
href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, the hosting company (<a
href="http://www.textdrive.com">TextDrive</a>) supports both <a
href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and <a
href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, so it's not an absolute
imperative.  Nonetheless, I'd rather experiment with <a
href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">RoR</a> than muck around with PHP.
The one and only experience that I've had with PHP was modifying
WordPress to <a
href="http://feedvalidator.org/docs/warning/EncodingMismatch.html">correctly</a>
report the content type and deal with the combination of encoding as
declared in the HTTP response and the <a
href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/spec">RSS</a> feed.  It could
have been a property of the version of WordPress (1.2 at the time, I
think), but I felt kind of dirty afterwards, the same way that I feel
after writing an <a
href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/applescript/">AppleScript</a>...</p>

<p>The typo distribution includes a convenience script for migrating a
WordPress database to typo, and it works well enough.  The only hitch
in migrating articles from the old WordPress ID-based permalink scheme
is that typo article numbers are allocated sequentially based on the
number of published articles, while WordPress doles out IDs based on
when the draft for the article was created or when the article was
published, whichever came first.  Since some drafts remain
unpublished, WordPress thinks that I have 128 articles with some gaps
in the IDs, while typo thinks that I imported 121 with no gaps in the
IDs.  It should be a quick exercise to cook up a controller to map the
old IDs to new IDs.  At some point, I'll get the rest of the content
from the <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio</a> and <a
href="http://www.snipsnap.org">SnipSnap</a> incarnations of pbblog
imported as well.</p>
