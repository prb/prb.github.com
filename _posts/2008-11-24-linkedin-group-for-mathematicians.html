<p>I can understand that some might find a bit of irony in a social
network for mathematicians, but I created a LinkedIn <a
href="http://www.linkedin.com/e/gis/1316107">group</a> for "current
and former mathematicians" late last week.</p>

<p>Mathematicians, where my working definition is people who have
significant formal training in the form of a Ph.D. or A.B.D. in
mathematics or a similar field like theoretical physics or computer
science, usually start out with a very narrow career trajectory
&#8212; academia.  Graduate mathematics programs have the job of
preparing students to be researchers.  There is barely an
acknowledgment of alternatives, but the realities of the economy and
academic job market will continue to draw (or drive) mathematicians to
other fields.  (Programs like <a
href="http://www.math.uic.edu/~misi/">MISI</a> at UIC, with which I
was involved when I was on the faculty at UIC, are a notable
exception.)</p>

<p>The reality is that there is no irony.  The mathematicians that I
know are equally distributed and successful across academia,
industrial applications (e.g., quantitative finance, marketing
analysis, etc.), and entrepreneurship; but formal training in
mathematics isn't one of the axes that LinkedIn or other social
networks support for search or networking.  I hope that the group is a
combination of:</p>

<ul>

<li>a support structure for mathematicians of any age pursuing or just
considering non-academic career tracks or even just extra-curricular
consulting;</li>

<li>a place to share interesting problems and opportunities;</li>

<li>a virtual tea time, which I miss.</li>

</ul>
