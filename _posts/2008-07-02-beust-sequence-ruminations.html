<p><a href="http://beust.com">C&#233;dric</a> <a href="http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000491.html">posted</a> a nice puzzle on his blog:</p>

<blockquote><p>[W]rite a counter function that counts from 1 to max
but only returns numbers whose digits don't repeat.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://crazybob.org">Bob</a> <a
href="http://twitter.com/crazybob/statuses/846377496">tweeted</a>
about a minimal <a
href="http://crazybob.org/BeustSequence.java.html">solution</a> in
terms of execution time, although (like the guy in the <a
href="http://stuffthathappens.com/blog/2008/07/02/script-kiddies/">cartoon</a>)
I still like my Haskell version of the sequence (up to some details
with use of <code>Data.Int.Int64</code> and typing the enumeration):</p>

<pre class="code">f k = [ n | n &lt;- [1..k], (length . show $ n) == (length . nub . show $ n) ]</pre>

<p>And the function to compute the maximum gap:</p>

<pre class="code">
drop_tail k = reverse . (drop k) . reverse
by_pairs u = zip (drop 1 u) (drop_tail 1 u)
g k = maximum . map (uncurry (-)) . by_pairs . f $ k</pre>

<p>This approach, while visually appealing, is unacceptably slow, even
with some of the usual optimizations applied. The fact is that any
solution that is implemented in terms of testing all of the numbers
between <code>0</code> and <code>k</code> will perform orders of
magnitude more poorly than the recursive style that Bob's using. But
how would I know that...?</p>

<h3>Subfactorials, Derangements, and Chooses</h3>

<p>A <em>derangement</em> is a permutation with no fixed points, e.g.,
<code>(123)</code> is a derangement of the set <code>{1,2,3}</code>,
but <code>(12)</code> is not because it maps <code>3</code> to
<code>3</code>. Like the number of permutations of an
<code>n</code>-element set (<code>n!</code>), the number of
derangements has its own function called the subfactorial and written
<code>!n</code>. MathWorld has a decent <a
href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Derangement.html">write-up</a>,
with the major takeaway for present purposes being that <code>!n ~
n!</code>.</p>

<p>The number of elements in C&#233;dric's set, for a fixed radix
<code>n</code> is the sum from <code>k=0</code> up to <code>n</code>
of <code>!k (n choose k)</code>, and that's <em>much</em> smaller than
<code>n<sup>n</sup></code>. (This reminds me of the whole "bad
shuffle" <a
href="http://mult.ifario.us/p/gap-bad-shuffle-and-playing-with-permutations">meme</a>
from a long time ago.)</p>

<p>Just how much less work does the enumeration approach require than
the iteration approach? Here's a quick snippet to compute the number
of derangements and the corresponding Beust number for a given radix:</p>

<pre class="code">fac :: Integer -> Integer
fac 0 = 1
fac n = n * (fac (n-1))

choose :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
choose n k = (fac n) `div` ((fac k) * (fac (n-k)))

d :: Integer -> Integer
d 1 = 0
d 2 = 1
d n = (n-1) * ( d (n-1) + d (n-2) )

b :: Integer -> Integer
b n = sum [ (d k) * (n `choose` k) | k &lt;- [ 1..n ] ]</pre>

<p>Then, <code>b<sub>10</sub></code> is <code>3628799</code>, so a
solution like Bob's should have around a 2500-fold advantage over a
more brute force method. And that advantage gets <em>huge</em> in
short order. As reminder of how much bigger <code>n<sup>n</sup></code>
is than <code>n!</code> and friends, <code>26<sup>26</sup></code> is
roughly <code>15,264,691,107</code> times larger than
<code>b<sub>26</sub></code>...</p>
