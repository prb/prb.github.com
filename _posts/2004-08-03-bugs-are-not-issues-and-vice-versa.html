<p>Confusion between bug tracking and issue tracking is altogether too common, and the two need to be separated for proper management.</p>

<p>A <em>bug</em> is a well-defined flaw or probable flaw in a piece of software, described in a fashion suitable for the engineers to interact with. An <em>issue</em> is effectively a question from a user about whether a result represents the correct behavior of that software, phrased by the user in their terms. Issues and bugs are related in a many-to-many fashion, although it is possible that an issue may not be a bug at all and that a bug may not have been detected or reported by a user.</p>

<p>A bug requires the attention of the engineers and needs to be assessed and prioritized as a work item for engineering. An issue requires the attention of support staff and should be addressed immediately in the interest of serving the customer's needs. The resolution of an issue, e.g., by means of a workaround, may not resolve the underlying bug or bugs. Conversely, the resolution of a bug may or may not resolve the issue. Among other things, the resolution of an underlying bug (when a fix is added to the codebase and verified) and the resolution of an issue (when the code is delivered the customer in a patch or subsequent release) will almost certainly occur at different times.</p>
