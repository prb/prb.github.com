<p>A recent <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6,467,086.WKU.&amp;OS=PN/6,467,086&amp;RS=PN/6,467,086">patent</a> granted to <a href="http://www.xerox.com/">Xerox</a> that includes <a href="http://www.aosd.net/">aspect-oriented programming</a> among its claims has provoked some interesting responses:</p>

<blockquote>I guess giving away Ethernet and the Mac UI was enough&hellip; [<a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx">Don Box's Spoutlet</a>]</blockquote>

<p>In spite of the width of the patent's claims, I have the hope and expectation that those claims and their scope will actually protect the technique as opposed to restricting it. Among other things, Xerox released <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/">AspectJ</a> first under the Mozilla Public License 1.1 and then under the <a href="http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/CPLv1.0.htm">Common Public License ("CPL") 1.0</a>. The relevant portion of the CPL 1.0 would be:</p>

<blockquote><small>"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS [...] b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</small></blockquote>

<p>So, as long as Xerox is a Contributor toward AspectJ, the CPL covers the royalty-free use of the patent within AspectJ. (Unfortunately, this sort of thing is not covered in the <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-cplfaq.html">CPL 1.0 FAQ</a>.)</p>
