<p>With the default <a href="http://www.erlang.org/">Erlang</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#38;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FConcurrent-Programming-Erlang-Robert-Virding%2Fdp%2F013508301X&#38;tag=pbblog-20&#38;linkCode=ur2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325">book</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pbblog-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> now over a decade old, a new one was sorely needed, and it looks like <a href="http://armstrongonsoftware.blogspot.com/">Joe Armstrong</a> has <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/jaerlang/">stepped up</a> (again).  (Hat-tip to <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/">Bill de H&oacute;ra</a> for the <a href="http://www.dehora.net/journal/2007/03/money_down.html">pointer</a> to the book, since I haven't been tracking the Erlang space lately.)  It's not in the beta PDF yet, but I'm looking forward to what is currently slated for Chapter 19:</p>

<blockquote>How to structure applications for programming multi-core CPUs. 
Increasing parallelism. Deciding the granularity of concurrency.</blockquote>

<p>Good stuff.</p>
