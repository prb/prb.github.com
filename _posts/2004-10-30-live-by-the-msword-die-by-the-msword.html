<p>As the saying goes, "Live by the MSWord, die by the MSWord."  <a href="http://www.fivesight.com">FiveSight</a> has accululated, between corporate infrastructure (articles and bylaws, filings, Board minutes, options plans, investments, employment agreements) and business relationships (licenses, support agreements, services agreements, distribution agreements) an <em>entire</em> filing cabinet full of legal documents, and all of it was written in Microsoft Word.</p>

<p>I'm <a href="http://blog.fivesight.com/prb/space/2003-11-16">no fan</a> of Microsoft Word to begin with, and I share the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html">sentiments</a> of those people who think that the use of <code>.doc</code> as an exchange format is ridiculous.</p>

<p>I was swimming through a 45-page contract a couple of weeks back, and hours of time spent unraveling track changes, fixing romanette references, and other low-grade psychological torture over the years came flashing back.  Contracts are just the tip of the iceberg, since more complex filings and briefs require tables of contents, references, and other things that are an absolute mess in Word.  There must be some way to convince lawyers to start using <a href="http://www.tug.org/">TeX</a>, although it looks like some <a href="http://w3.msi.vxu.se/~pku/MacOSX_TeX/2003a/msg03049.html">already have</a>.  We could call it... L<sub>AW</sub>T<sub>E</sub>X...</p>
