<p>I haven't made many (any?) political statements here, although it should be easy enough to guess my politics (<a href="http://www.reed.edu">Reed</a> + <a href="http://www.math.berkeley.edu">Berkeley</a> &ne; Republican), but I've been getting more and more fed up with what I see and hear.  (Most recently, I heard on NPR that Jr. will be reading a eulogy for President Ford; I imagine that a very nice eulogy can be written for third-grade level.  "See Gerald.  See Gerald lead...")  Even so, it's going to take more than a few years of a moron as president to kill off our culture.</p>

<p>On the other hand, tainting our food supply could turn out to be the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire">lead in our aqueducts</a>.  (I know that metaphor is less than apt, as the lead theory doesn't mesh with the fact that the aqueducts ran continuously; nonetheless...)  In the spirit of "what you don't know can't hurt you", the FDA <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cvm/CloneRiskAssessment.htm">declared</a> that meat and milk from clones is safe to eat.  From the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cvm/CloningRA_ChapterI.htm">executive summary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Applied to the safety of edible products derived from clones, a finding of "no additional risk" would mean that food products derived from animal clones or their progeny would not pose any additional risk relative to corresponding products from conventional animals, or that they are as safe as foods that we eat every day. As with all risk assessments, some uncertainty is inherent either in the approach we have used or in the data themselves.</blockquote>

<p>The reasoning in the report is that if a cloned animal lives to a late juvenile or adult stage, then there probably isn't anything wrong with it, i.e., damaged animals are likely to be less viable individuals.  That equivalence is tenuous, but the unspoken assertion that a cloned animal is cow-equivalent for human consumption because it is viable is unfounded and probably wrong.  This brings up an interesting moral paradox.  On the one hand, it's immoral to experiment on people, so no carefully controlled studies of cloned meat's effect on human subjects can be done prior to introducing it to market.  However, introducing cloned meat to the market is effectively an experiment on the public at large.  If the meat is labeled as from cloned animals, then at least the public can "choose" whether or not to be experimental subjects or not.  (I put quotes around "choose" because economics are likely to guide people's choices.)</p>

<p>I'll keep my <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/purple/">purple cows</a> on the bookshelf, thank you.</p>
