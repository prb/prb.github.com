<p>I'd like to add both a sidebar with my bookmarks and some per-entry
chrome for posts bookmarked on <a
href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, but I don't want to use
client-side Javascript to do it.  The alternative is to pull, cache,
and manage the data on the server side.  As a prototype, I whipped
up a simple Haskell program that uses the del.icio.us JSON APIs (for
<a href="http://del.icio.us/help/json/posts">posts</a> and for <a
href="http://del.icio.us/help/json/url">URLs</a>), and it contained a
couple of surprising detours.</p>

<h3>Some Haskell</h3>

<p>First up, some Haskell.  After going shopping on <a
href="http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html">Hackage</a>, I
installed <a
href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/HTTP"><code>Network.HTTP</code></a>,
Thomas DuBuisson's <a
href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/pureMD5">pureMD5</a>
package, and the JSON package from <a
href="http://www.tom.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~sakai">Masahiro Sakai</a> and Jun
Mukai (cabalized version is <a
href="http://datapr0n.com/repos/perpubplat/json/">here</a>).  Like all
code that builds on a decent set of libraries, the Haskell code to hit
del.icio.us is straightforward; full source is <a
href="http://mult.ifario.us/files/delicious_client.hs">here</a>, so
I'll just post some fragments below to give a flavor of the code.</p>

<p>Create a structure to hold the data:</p>

<pre class="code">data DeliciousBookmark = DeliciousBookmark { bookmark_url :: String
                                           , description :: String
                                           , tags :: [String] }
                         deriving ( Show, Eq, Ord )</pre>

<p>Build the request:</p>

<pre class="code">bookmarks_fragment :: String
bookmarks_fragment = "http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/"

request_for_bookmarks :: String -> Request
request_for_bookmarks user = Request ( fromJust . parseURI $
                                       bookmarks_fragment ++ user ++ "?raw" )
                             GET [] ""</pre>
<p>Send it:</p>

<pre class="code">fetch_bookmarks :: String -> IO [DeliciousBookmark]
fetch_bookmarks user = do { res &lt;- simpleHTTP . request_for_bookmarks $ user
                          ; case res of
                              Right (Response (2,0,0) _ _ body) ->
                                  return $ process_bookmarks_body body
                          }</pre>

<p>And then parse and walk through the response body:</p>

<pre class="code">parse_crufty_json :: String -> J.Value
parse_crufty_json = parse_json . unescape . utf8_decode
    where
      parse_json = \s -> case (parse J.json "" s) of
                           Left err -> error . show $ err
                           Right v -> v

process_bookmarks_body :: String -> [DeliciousBookmark]
process_bookmarks_body body =
    case parse_crufty_json body of
      J.Array a ->
          map (process_bookmark . uno) a

process_bookmark :: M.Map String J.Value -> DeliciousBookmark
process_bookmark m =
    DeliciousBookmark { bookmark_url = uns $ M.findWithDefault blank "u" m
                      , description = uns $ M.findWithDefault blank "d" m 
                      , tags = map uns $ una $ M.findWithDefault empty_array "t" m }

blank = J.String ""
empty_array = J.Array []
uno (J.Object o) = o
uns (J.String s) = s</pre>

<p>And that's all there is to it, except that &#8212; as might be expected from the <code>parse_crufty_json</code> function &#8212; there were a few things
that didn't work on the first pass.</p>

<h3>Bytes and Characters</h3>

<p>The first wrinkle I ran into with the simple del.icio.us client
occurred in <code>process_bookmarks_body</code>.  The Haskell
<code>String</code> that comes from the HTTP response structure is
just a straight conversion of the response body from bytes to
character ordinals.  This is all well and good if the body is encoded
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8859-1">ISO-8859-1</a>,
but it's fraught with peril otherwise.  The del.icio.us service sends
back <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> (and
ignores an <code>Accept-Charset</code> <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.2">header</a>
instead either returning a correctly encoded response or a
<code>406</code> response code), so any interesting characters will
cause problems.  In this case, what should be <code>Solutoire.com
\8250 Plotr</code> is coming through as <code>Solutoire.com
\226\128\186 Plotr</code>.  Writing a decoder is no big deal and an
opportunity to play a quick round of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl#Perl_golf">golf</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of making HTTP in Haskell better, there was apparently a
Google SoC project <a
href="http://code.google.com/soc/2007/haskell/appinfo.html?csaid=D4DEE221DAC4E810">proposed</a>
to integrate <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> via FFI and
Haskell's <code>ByteString</code> API, but it doesn't look like
anything's come of it.</p>

<h3>RFC-compliant JSON versus Works For Me in JavaScript</h3>

<p>The second wrinkle with the simple del.icio.us client is more
pernicious.  After I resolved the string encoding issues, I started
getting errors of the form:</p>

<pre class="code">parse error at (line 1, column 1552):
unexpected "'"
expecting "\"", "\\", "/", "b", "f", "n", "r", "t" or "u"</pre>

<p>And sure enough, on inspection, there's an escaped apostrophe
lurking in the JSON.  This probably wouldn't bother a client who
simply evaluated the JSON as literal JavaScript (which seems to be the
intent of the API), but it's not legal JSON and the parser correctly
signals an error.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> grammar (per
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt">RFC 4627</a>) permits a
few escapes, and apostrophe is not among them.  To wit:</p>

<pre>         string = quotation-mark *char quotation-mark

         char = unescaped /
                escape (
                    %x22 /          ; "    quotation mark  U+0022
                    %x5C /          ; \    reverse solidus U+005C
                    %x2F /          ; /    solidus         U+002F
                    %x62 /          ; b    backspace       U+0008
                    %x66 /          ; f    form feed       U+000C
                    %x6E /          ; n    line feed       U+000A
                    %x72 /          ; r    carriage return U+000D
                    %x74 /          ; t    tab             U+0009
                    %x75 4HEXDIG )  ; uXXXX                U+XXXX

         escape = %x5C              ; \

         quotation-mark = %x22      ; "

         unescaped = %x20-21 / %x23-5B / %x5D-10FFFF</pre>

<p>Apostrophe is <code>U+0027</code>.</p>

<p>As with the UTF-8 issues, it's a quick job to implement a filter to
scan for escaped apostrophes and unescape them, but it would be nice
if what is advertised as JSON was actually JSON.</p>
