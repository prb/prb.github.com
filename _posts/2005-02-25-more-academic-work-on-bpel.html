<p>I've added a <a href="http://del.icio.us/prb/bpel+academic">tag</a> to my del.icio.us <a href="http://del.icio.us/prb">bookmarks</a> for academic work about BPEL.  The list is non-exhaustive, and I'll add items to it as I come across them.  (If you know of something substantial that I'm missing, <a href="mailto:prb@fivesight.com">let me know</a>.)  Thanks to <a href="http://www.del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, you can also get the items as an <a href="http://del.icio.us/rss/prb/bpel+academic">RSS feed</a>.</p>
