<p>I pre-ordered a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#38;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FProgramming-Haskell-Graham-Hutton%2Fdp%2F0521692695&#38;tag=pbblog-20&#38;linkCode=ur2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325">Programming in Haskell</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pbblog-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> by <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/">Graham Hutton</a> from Amazon last year, and once it showed up last month, its ~150 pages were a quick and pleasant read.</p>

<p>For an experienced programmer who's happy with dirt under their nails, materials for learning Haskell are available on line: the classic <a href="http://www.haskell.org/tutorial/">Gentle Introduction to Haskell</a>, the <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/">Haskell Wiki</a>, and the <a href="http://haskell.org/onlinereport/">Haskell Report</a> (language specification and source code for core libraries).  Also, the folks on <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell-cafe">Haskell Cafe</a> and the Haskell <a href="http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/HaskellIrcChannel">IRC channel</a> are generally receptive to beginner questions that aren't obviously <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Homework_help">homework</a>...</p>

<p>And this brings me to the first strength of the book: the stated target audience for Programming in Haskell is the "absolute beginner", and the book does a good job playing to that audience.  Recursion, higher-order functions, and laziness all appear in the book but relatively late and with a good amount of supporting exposition and some rules of thumb.  Formal reasoning about Haskell programs (proof by computation, induction, etc.) appear only in the last chapter, and <a href="http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/basic.html#sect6.1.7"><tt>IO</tt></a> is presented without more general discussion of monads but with adequate discussion of the conflict between side-effects and a purely functional language.</p>

<p>The book's other major strength is in the examples.  Each chapter includes compact, uncontrived, and interesting examples, which is a major feat for any textbook.  I particularly liked the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown_(game_show)">Countdown</a> examples.  I can see this being a good textbook for an introductory course, and with lecture slides available from the <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/book.html">site</a> for the book and supporting materials available from the publisher, the author has clearly gone out of his way to make it a good choice as a textbook.</p>

<p>As for non-positives, I've already spent time mucking through the online materials about Haskell and on a few other books on the topic (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#38;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHaskell-Road-Logic-Maths-Programming%2Fdp%2F0954300696%2F&#38;tag=pbblog-20&#38;linkCode=ur2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325">The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths, and Programming</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pbblog-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#38;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHaskell-School-Expression-Functional-Programming%2Fdp%2F0521644089%2F&#38;tag=pbblog-20&#38;linkCode=ur2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325">The Haskell School of Expression</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pbblog-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&#38;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPurely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki%2Fdp%2F0521663504%2F&#38;tag=pbblog-20&#38;linkCode=ur2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=9325">Purely Functional Data Structures</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=pbblog-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />), so I didn't take any new knowledge about Haskell away from the book.  Nonetheless, I did find a few things to take away from the book, e.g., a technique for compactly generating the powerlist (all sublists) of a list that was part of the Countdown example.</p>

<p>Other than the price seeming a bit much on a per-page basis, the only other thing that bugged me about the book &#8212; and only because I used to be a working mathematician &#8212; was this statement about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> on p. 94:</p>

<blockquote>That is, we can think of the board as really being a torus, a three-dimensional doughnut-shaped object.</blockquote>

<p>The game board is indeed a torus, but a torus is a two-dimensional object.  One representation of a torus embedded in three-dimensional space would be as the surface of a doughnut, but that representation is not what defines a torus.  A torus is a two-dimensional surface obtained as the cartesian product of two circles.  An equivalent construction is to create a torus by gluing opposite sides of a square, like so:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://blog.prb.io/files/torus.png" /></p>

<p>Living on a torus with the usual metric is like playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(game)">Asteroids</a>; if you fly off the {top,bottom,left,right} of the screen at some angle, you fly on the {bottom,top,right,left} at the same angle.  Or, to put it another way, if you were a two-dimensional creature, it would be like being on a plane where there were infinitely many copies of you, placed at points with two integer coordinates.  While this is admittedly a bit of a niggle, I emailed Graham, so hopefully this shows up as an <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh/errata.html">erratum</a>.</p>
