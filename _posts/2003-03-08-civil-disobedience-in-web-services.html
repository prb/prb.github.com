<p>A recent <a href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2912083,00.html">article</a> on ZDNet entitled "Web Services in Serious Jeopardy" reviews the intellectual property issues swirling around <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-bpel/">BPEL4WS</a>, and <a href="http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/filters/columnarchive/0,14239,267,00.html">David Berlind</a> takes a hard stance with respect to adoption:</p>

<blockquote>What can you do? Refuse to develop anything with BPEL4WS or the applications servers that support it (to the exclusion of something standard) until the specification is royalty-free.</blockquote>
