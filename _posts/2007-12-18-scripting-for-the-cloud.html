<p>Paul Fremantle <a href="http://pzf.fremantle.org/2007/12/soa-and-unix-pipelines.html">posted</a> a brief analogy between classic UNIX pipelines and scripting for web services, and I posted a <a href="http://pzf.fremantle.org/2007/12/soa-and-unix-pipelines.html#c8852632169991456395">comment</a> about some work going on with <a href="http://ode.apache.org">Ode</a> that deserves a bit broader audience.  <a href="http://offthelip.org/">Matthieu</a>, <a href="http://www.taval.de/">Tammo</a>, et al are working on a Javascripty language called SimPEL that maps to BPEL.  They're making good progress, and the <a href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/ode/sandbox/simpel/src/test/resources/loan-approval.simpel?revision=605313">straw man</a> examples are looking good, both for terseness and for legibility.  It's still a way off, but it's on its way.</p>

<p>XML languages are <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2006/01/15/xml-languages-and-sins-of-syntax">known</a> to be awful (hard on the hands, hard on the eyes, underspecified by document- or data-oriented schemata), and an orchestration DSL that maps onto BPEL has been on various wish lists for a while.  (See, e.g., Brian's <a href="http://kasparov.skife.org/blog/src/java/bpelscript.html">thought</a>.)  WSDL and XSLT should also be on the chopping block, and there are at least a few general approaches to abbreviating an XML syntax from which to draw inspiratiom.  (See., e.g., <a href="http://relaxng.org/">RELAX NG</a> <a href="http://relaxng.org/compact-20021121.html">compact syntax</a> and <a href="http://blog.moertel.com/">Tom Moertel</a>'s <a href="http://community.moertel.com/pxsl/">PXSL</a>.)</p>
