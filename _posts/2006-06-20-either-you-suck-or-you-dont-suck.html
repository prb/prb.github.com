<p>It takes some big hairy coconuts to knock on someone's front door and announce that you'd like to eat their lunch, so I assume that <a href="http://beta.zooomr.com/about/letter">Kristopher Tate</a> is half man and half palm tree.  (The usual approach is to sneak up on them, even just a little bit, but then you don't usually ape their name, either...)  On the other hand, either you suck or you don't suck.  Either your business is solid or it isn't.  Either you have a complete product or you don't.  Either your customers love you or they don't.  Either you can move faster than your competitors or you can't.  Refusal to compete is admission of weakness, so it's great to see Flickr <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/06/api_keys_for_direct_competitor.html">step up</a> to Zoomr's challenge.</p>

<p>On the flip side, I see my Flickr photos as just that &#8212; <em>mine</em>.  So don't use feudalistic control of your API as pseudo-DRM to lock me into your service, unless you want to ensure that I'll take my business elsewhere on principle.  Instead of creating competitors by forcing people to work around you, either go so fast that no one can keep up or ensure that your service is so open, so flexible, and so compelling that people extend it rather than imitate it with minor twists.</p>
