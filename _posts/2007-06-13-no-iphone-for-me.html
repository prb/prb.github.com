<p>My cellular service contract was coming up for renewal this month, and I'd been <a href="http://blog.prb.io/gestures-and-a-better-mouse.html">thinking</a> about buying an iPhone as an experiment.  After thinking it over and without waiting for WWDC to happen, I bought a BlackBerry 8800 instead, and this fragment from the WWDC "Jobsnote" transcript (gone missing, so no link) on <a href="http://www.macrumors.com">MacRumors</a> explains my reasoning perfectly:</p>

<blockquote>11:22 am, Head of Apple iPhone software had some trouble typing with the iPhone on-screen keyboard.</blockquote>

<p>With all of the various mobile devices and phones that I've used (since the Newton was unable to decipher my handwriting), I've never thought that the UI wasn't pretty enough or "If only I could watch a tiny movie right now..."  I've always hated the user interface and data synchronization experience.</p>

<p>So far, I'm pleased as punch with the Blackberry.  The QWERTY-esqe (QWERTY for letters, modifier keys for numbers and symbols) keyboard and scroll nub is the only usable user interface that I've ever used, and that includes touch screen keyboards accessed with a stylus on PDA devices.  The application stack is also a win for me, since there's direct support for GMail, Google Talk, Google Maps (the 8800 has GPS functionality), and the combination of <a href="http://www.markspace.com/missingsync_blackberry.php">Missing Sync</a> and <a href="http://spanningsync.com/">Spanning Sync</a> synchronizes the Blackberry's calendar with my Google Calendar with my iCal on my various Macs.  (I opted for Missing Sync over <a href="http://www.pocketmac.net/products/pmblackberry/">PocketMac</a> after talking with some other Blackberry/Mac users about their synchronization experiences.)</p>

<p>The one open item is whether and how to push my open items from <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com">Remember The Milk</a>, since the <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/mobile/">mobile interface</a> isn't that usable (IMHO), but I'll probably use the <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/googlegears/">offline support</a> via <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a> to just leave that laptop-only functionality.</p>

<p>All of the various user interfaces (web, mobile, console) for the different components and the multi-hop synchronization will make an interesting case study in whether this works well from a user perspective.</p>
