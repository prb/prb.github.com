<p>Back in 2003 or 2004, when FiveSight was thinking about raising VC
money, I had an informal lunch meeting with a Chicago-area venture
capitalist (pretty sure it was <a

Xbhytrbetr</a>) somewhere in either the Gold Coast or Old Town
neighborhoods in Chicago.  I honestly don't remember much of the
content of the conversation other than that an elevator pitch for a
middleware company launching a new product effort neither got him
excited nor appeared to spoil his lunch.  We finished up and walked
out together.</p>

<p>I was driving the same beater that I drove up until the birth of
our first child in 2005, a <a

Acura Integra</a> that I'd bought used when I finished grad school.
Along the same lines as the <a

in the lobby</a>, I didn't want to take a chance on sending the wrong
message to a potential investor, so I was hoping that we weren't
parked where he'd walk by my car on the way to his.  I was happy when
we got to the door and he dispatched the valet fetched his car, and then I was
surprised when the valet pulled up in an even older beater than mine.
(A rusty and rusty-colored <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Fox#North_American_Fox">VW
Fox</a>, I think.)</p>

<p>And then he bummed $10 off me to pay the valet because he wasn't
carrying any cash...</p>
