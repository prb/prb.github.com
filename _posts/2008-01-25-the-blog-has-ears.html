<p>I opened up comments about a week ago on a provisional basis, and
after fixing a couple of issues with ordering (and writing some <a
href="http://datapr0n.com/repos/perpubplat/perpubplat/testsrc/Blog/Model/EntryTests.hs">unit
tests</a>), it should be good for general consumption.</p>

<p>A few design choices with the motivation behind them:</p>

<ul>

<li>No CAPTCHA, AJAX-only forms, or other silliness to keep out the
spammers, since those approaches don't really work and effectively
punish the user instead of the spammers.  In its place, moderation and
a one-off platform that offers security through obscurity will have to
do for starters.  If things become a problem, I'd prefer a Bayesian
approach anyway.</li>

<li>Comment formatting is provided through a simplistic macro language
that's similar to the kind of markup supported in comments on Reddit.
I thought about attempting to sanitize HTML or XHTML, but I wanted
rigid limits on the types of formatting available and on the XHTML
eventually stored in a comment and served in page views or feeds.</li>

<li>Unapproved comments use a separate internal channel and
persistence mechanism, so other than request routing, spammers won't
impair the experience for legitimate users.</li>

</ul>

<h3>What's Next...</h3>

<p>I've got a pipeline of other features that I'd like to add, like
backlinks to referrers, draft management workflow, some social chrome
for del.icio.us and Reddit, and a Javascript-free Flickr collage; and
those will follow along at the rate of one every few weeks.</p>
