<p>For context, see my earlier <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2006/11/26/peanut-butter-jelly-and-effectiveness-of-engineering-spend">post</a> on Yahoo, Amazon, Google and the effectiveness of "stepping on the gas" with R&#38;D.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.investor.reuters.com/GoTo.aspx?author=Marc+Gerstein&amp;.t=articlearchive%2Fbyauthor">Marc Gerstein</a> over at <a href="http://www.seekingalpha.com">SeekingAlpha</a> has some <a href="http://internet.seekingalpha.com/article/21311">comments</a> from a similar perspective (ratios between engineering expense and revenue), although he draws a different conclusion about Amazon:</p>

<blockquote><small>For Amazon.com (AMZN), analysts have focused investor worries on the monies being spent to draw in customers. They're right to hone in on the spending levels, but they've been overly alarmist on the worry bit. Heavy spending on marketing and technology has worked for Amazon.</small></blockquote>

<p>I maintain that the interesting proposition for Amazon (Yahoo, EBay, Google, etc.) is not how effective engineering spend was in the past but rather how effective it will be in the future.</p>
