<p>I'm a <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2005/02/24/random-musings-on-thikis-verb-searches-and-personal-groupware">fan</a> of thick clients for web applications, even those with front ends that would be nice by web or even Web&#160;2.0 standards.  I'm not going to trade my OS in for a browser anytime soon.</p><p>Like <a href="http://timtam.codehaus.org/">TimTam</a> for <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a>, I'm enjoying <a href="http://1001.kung-foo.tv/">1001</a> as a non-browser front-end for uploading to <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> &#8212; drag an image or two over from <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto</a>, select a couple of tags, type blurbs, hit "Upload", and it's done.</p>
