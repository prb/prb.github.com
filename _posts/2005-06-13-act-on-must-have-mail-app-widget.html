<p>I've been waiting for this for a while -- on <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/06/mail_acton_invo.html">43 Folders</a> today, a post about <a href="http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html">Act-On</a>, a bundle for Mail.app that binds key sequences to rule actions.  It's like a little slice of <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> in Mail.app, so I'm one step closer to a mouse-free user experience.  Even better, unlike AppleScript actions, Act-On has the property that a "move to folder" command correctly repositions the current message cursor.</p>
