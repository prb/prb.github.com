<p>This is a post that I've been meaning to write anyway, but it's also in response to part of JJ's <a href="http://blogs.fivesight.com/pbblog/index.php?p=15#comment-2">comment</a> on an earlier <a href="http://blogs.fivesight.com/pbblog/index.php?p=15">post</a>.</p>

<p>BPEL is not a programming language.  Perhaps more to the point, BPEL is not an application programming language, i.e., BPEL can't be used to write an application.  Instead, a BPEL engine is a point solution to the challenges of service orchestration in the same way that a database is a point solution to the challenges of data management.  The statement that "SQL is not an application programming language" is analogous.</p>

<p>This summarizes my expectations of and aspirations for BPEL.  BPEL holds promise for reducing the software engineering cost and complexity of building applications with services.  BPEL will be a substantial part of B2B applications, integration applications, and all manner of other software engineering endeavors, but it's only a part of the overall picture.</p>
