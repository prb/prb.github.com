<p>The <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2005/11/26/migrated-to-typo">initial migration</a> (and a subsequent upgrade from 2.6.0 to svn trunk) was pretty much painless, but the database migration didn't take care of mapping permalinks or date queries from the WordPress scheme to the typo scheme.  Enter a little <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html"><code>mod_rewrite</code></a> and Ruby (at which I'm a newbie).</p>

<p>The first step is to grab the query string on the old server, e.g., to grab the WordPress-style permalink:</p>

<pre class="code">http://oldblog/?p=69</pre>

<p>to a new entry point in typo like:</p>

<pre class="code">http://newblog/wp/69</pre>

<p>the required bit of <code>mod_rewrite</code> script is:</p>

<pre class="code">RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} p=([^&amp;;]+)
RewriteRule ^/$ http://newblog/wp/%1? [R=301,L]</pre>

<p>(The trailing <code>?</code> drops the query string in the redirected URL, and back references use the <code>%</code> in place of the <code>$</code>.)  The <code>301</code> response code is <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">"moved permanently"</a>, so well-behaved clients should get the idea.  The same technique applies to the query string-defined syndication protocols that WordPress uses for the <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss">RSS</a> and <a href="http://atompub.org/">Atom</a> feeds.</p>

<p>The next bit of work in Ruby is a bit painful because of the way that the database migration script maps the IDs.  (If I was in the mood, I could have modified the migration script to dump an id cross-references, but I wasn't and didn't.)  The first piece is a new route in <code>config/routes.rb</code>:</p>

<pre class="code">map.connect 'wp/:wpid',
  :controller => 'articles', :action => 'wp'</pre>

<p>And then a bit of Ruby in <code>app/controllers/articles_controller.rb</code>:</p>

<pre class="code">def wp
  begin
    wpid = params[:wpid].to_i
    case wpid
      when (109..109) then wpid = 97
      when (100..101) then wpid -= 15
      # etc.
    end
    # imitate the "read" method here...
  end
</pre>

<p>And that should do it.  (So far, the most difficult part of Ruby is not typing a <code>;</code> at the end of a line...)</p>
