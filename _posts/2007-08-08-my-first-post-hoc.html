<p>After reading the recent Time <a href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1650352,00.html">article</a> about <a href="http://www.babyeinstein.com/">Baby Einstein</a>, I have wonder if early childhood education about statistics and logical reasoning can prevent bad studies in future generations.  The authors of the cited study have an <a href="http://www.maketvwork.com/">ax</a> to grind on the subject, and that's not necessarily a bad thing &#8212; I don't think any reasonable person would fail to be appalled by the statistic in the article that 90% of children are spending two to three hours a day in front of a screen.  Nonetheless, I find this statement troubling:</p>

<blockquote>Three studies have shown that watching television, even if it includes educational programming such as Sesame Street, delays language development.</blockquote>

<p>I'm willing to accept a statement that babies and toddlers who watch more television also develop more slowly than their peers, but that hardly establishes a causal relationship.  <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/">Dubner and Levitt</a> would try to convince us that both outcomes (watching television and slower development) are correlated to the socioeconomic status of the parents.</p>

<p>I should figure out some way to make money off of <em>post hoc</em> fallacies &#8212; some way other than writing books and publishing articles that contain them, that is.</p>
