<p><img align="left" src="http://blog.prb.io/files/bjpmag.jpg"/>I got a SPAM this weekend for &quot;Blogger and Podcaster Magazine&quot;.  In all likelihood, this is just a case of someone identifying a demographic where the advertising revenues from a magazine could exceed the cost of printing and mailing a bunch of free copies, but this strikes me as a case of unclear on the concept.  A hard copy, snail-mailed magazine targeted at people who are deeply involved in blogging, podcasting, and other purely on-line activities?  That's just the kind of content that you can't find on-line... [<em>sic</em>.]</p>

<p>I don't get it, but maybe that's just  me.</p>
