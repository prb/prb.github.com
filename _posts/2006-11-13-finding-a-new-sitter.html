<p>Our current <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/p-r-b/295078388">sitter</a> is just about perfect: good-natured, senior from UW, energetic, down-to-earth, experienced with children, and well-liked by the kid.  Nonetheless, she's graduating soon and then going to grad school, so we'll have to find someone new and break them in before our current sitter is unavailable.  People are understandably guarded about their babysitters and nannies, so we're expecting to have to start from scratch rather than getting a referral from a friend.  (There's probably some interesting economics or game theory lurking around, as it seems like an extreme case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry">asymmetric information</a> or an inverse case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signaling_(economics)">signaling</a>.)</p>

<p>The wife and I joke about trying to pick up a new sitter on the UW campus:  "Hi.  If you need some extra money, my wife and I were wondering if you'd be interested in coming over every couple of weeks and watching...  No no no, watching <em>our kid</em>."  In all seriousness, UW and SPU both have <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/coe/">education</a> <a href="http://www.spu.edu/soe/">programs</a>, and a couple of postings may get us what we're looking for.  </p>

<p>The question of whether or not we'd consider a "manny" or male babysitter is interesting to me, since my inclination is "no".  I see myself as a competent and nurturing father, so clearly men can be successful caregivers.  Nonetheless, I would much sooner trust a female babysitter than a male babysitter if for no other reason than a twenty-something male having a nurturing interest in children is sufficiently outside of statistical bounds as to make me suspicious about motivations.</p>
