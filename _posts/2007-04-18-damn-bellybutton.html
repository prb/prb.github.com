<p>I don't look at my real world belly button all that often, and realistically, if it's not there, it's not a big deal; I was done with it a long time ago.  On the other hand, when I do indulge in a little metaphorical <a href="http://www.backupbrain.com/2002_05_19_archive.html#a002098">navel gazing</a>, I'll be damned if my weblog isn't missing about half the time.  Again, it's not a big deal, since <a href="http://wwww.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a> keeps the fire burning for any subscribers, but it's still annoying if not a bit embarrassing.</p>

<p>Back when I started having <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2006/10/10/typo-textdrive-happy">trouble</a> with typo, I signed up for an account on <a href="http://mon.itor.us">mon.itor.us</a> to get an idea of how much of a problem it was, and it's been pretty boring since I moved it off of <a href="http://textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a> .  As configured and hosted, it provides "one-and-a-half nines" or around 95% uptime, except when it really sucks wind.  Speaking of which,  here are the response time graphs for the 16th-18th:</p>

<p>The period of about two days out of the three where the graph is pegged at the top represent effective downtime.  Flickr &#8212; or rather the lightweight integration of Flickr into typo &#8212; was the culprit, <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2006/12/21/oh-no-you-didnt">again</a>, but I opted to disable it rather than fix it.</p>
