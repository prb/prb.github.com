<p>Back in the late 1980's and very early 1990's, I experimented with bedroom music production using a couple of keyboards (an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensoniq_ESQ-1">Ensoniq ESQ-1</a> and later an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensoniq_EPS">Ensoniq EPS</a>) and a Tascam four-tracker.  (I'm surprised to find that Tascam still makes cassette-based <a href="http://www.tascam.com/PersonalCreativity.html#Cassette_PortaStudios">recorders</a>.)  To set the technology scene for the very early 1990's, Windows was at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft_Windows">3.1</a>, MacOS was at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_history#System_7">System 7</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Computer">NeXT</a> started shipping the NeXTstation.  (A NeXTstation was my computer of choice from 1990-1995.)</p>

<p>I recently started experimenting with music again, and so far, I'm impressed with the improvements from the last fifteen years of advances.  (Certainly, the increase in the utility of a computer for making music is orders of magnitude larger than the increase in the utility of a computer for writing documents.)</p>

<p>The first thing that I did was rip a <a href="http://blog.prb.io/files/Simple_Loop.mp3">few</a> of my old recordings to MP3s using <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> via a tape deck connected to a <a href="http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/FirewireAudiophile-main.html">Firewire interface</a>.  Next, I downloaded some software synthesis packages to experiment with: <a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason">Reason</a>, <a href="http://www.nativeinstruments.de/index.php?id=reaktor5_us">Reaktor</a>, and <a href="http://www.cycling74.com/products/maxmsp">Max/MSP</a>.</p>

<p>Reaktor was the one that I bought.  It offers the standard GUI that imitates the front panel of a rack-mountable synthesizer, and at least from the perspective of someone who shops at <a href="http://www.bleep.com">Bleep</a>, it comes with a great set of instruments &#8212; synthesizers, sequencers, "grooveboxes", effects, and other widgets that defy categorization.</p>

<p>Under the covers, Reaktor provides a visual, flow-oriented programming environment called Core where GUI components (knobs, lamps, level meters, ADSR graphs, etc.), DSP components, MIDI components, various operations, envelopes, LFOs, oscillators, and filters can be wired together and composed into virtual instruments.  Better yet, all of the instruments supplied with Reaktor have the "source" included, so tweaking is easy.</p>

<p>Max/MSP was the first runner up, with an instrument construction environment similar to Reaktor's but a much thinner collection of example instruments.  It turns out that there's a similar system under development as open source called <a href="http://www.puredata.org/">Pure Data</a> or "Pd" that runs on multiple systems.  There's a <a href="http://www.crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/techniques.htm">book-in-progress</a> on electronic music that uses Pd, a collection of "externals" for Pd hosted at <a href="http://pure-data.sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a>, and even a <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/atl/pd/tutorial/">tool</a> ("Paradiddle") to bind Cocoa user interfaces onto Pd patches.  (Miller Puckette is the guy behind Pd and originally part of the team behind Max/MSP, so the similarity is not accidental.)</p>

<p>As for the second runner-up, Reason has a neat user interface that imitates the front and back of a rack full of equipment, complete with a spaghetti of cables connecting components together, and it's very easy to pile-up enough equipment to convince yourself that $500 in software (not counting the computer hardware to run the software) buys you $100,000+ worth of technology at early 1990's capabilities.  Nonetheless, it left me feeling like it was very workstation-ish and subtly constrained.</p>

<p>Now I just need some free time to spend on some compositions...</p>
