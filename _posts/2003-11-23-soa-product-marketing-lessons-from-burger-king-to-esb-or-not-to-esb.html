<p>On a walk with my wife Friday night, I was struck by the number of optometrists crammed into one stretch. Perhaps my neighborhood is just full of myopic people, but it is a <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/papers/twerp661.pdf">well-known</a> fact that the best place to put a Burger King is across the street from a McDonald's. This got me thinking about the ESB and product marketing in the service-oriented architecture space.</p>

<p>Being first is good, e.g., &#8220;first-mover advantage&#8221;, if people know where you're going. I think that the ESB (<em>E</em>nterprise <em>S</em>ervice <em>B</em>us), a term coined by Gartner for one of Sonic Software's products, is going to turn out to be an interesting case study, since, as <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/207">Dave Chappell</a> <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/3937">points out</a>, it seems to be turning into a legitimate product category with the in-kind entry of IBM and WebMethods. (A messaging bus itself is not new: the first three letters in <a href="http://www.tibco.com/">TIBCO</a> are an acronym for <em>T</em>he <em>I</em>nformation <em>B</em>us, software that was developed in the mid-1980's and whose commercialization formed the basis for TIBCO's products.)</p>

<p>The question of the moral higher ground in the ESB space is moot: with a concise definition, a burger is a burger, so decide whether you want it flame-broiled, prefer a bundle with industry-leading fries, or would rather spend three times as much to get it on a plate with table service. (If you ask me, the best burgers on the planet are served at a <a href="http://www.stanichs.com/">tavern</a> in Portland, OR.)</p>

<p>While I haven't decided what I think of ESBs as an architectural construct, we need more concrete concepts like the ESB as a means of customer education and categorization. In my non-MBA's view of software product marketing, any marketing message boils down to, in no particular order, who it's for, what it is, why it's necessary, and how it's used.</p>

<p>The challenge for vendors in the service-oriented architecture space is to create more burgers.</p>
