<p>After multiple bad experiences with Mac OS X updates from Apple, I bought a 0.5TB <a href="http://www.lacie.com">LaCie</a> "Big Disk" and started religiously making backups with <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper">SuperDuper!</a>.  (The exclamation point is part of the name...)  <a href="http://www.macfixit.com/article.php?story=20050810082341453">Most folks</a> don't seem to have trouble with the updates, but they've consistently been problematic for me.  The Big Disk didn't make the cut for items that we initially brought to Seattle with us, so I fell off the <a href="http://blog.prb.io/made-the-move-to-mac.html">backup wagon</a> for a couple of months while we house hunted.</p><p>As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law">Murphy's Law</a> would dictate, the original drive in my PowerBook reported a failure via S.M.A.R.T. ("<a href="http://smartlinux.sourceforge.net/smart">Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology</a>", not "<a href="http://www.topachievement.com/smart.html">Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Tangible</a>") and refused to mount due to corruption in the structure of the filesystem.  To make matters worse, <tt>fsck</tt> from single-user mode failed for the same reason.  It would have been nice if the S.M.A.R.T. functionality had warned me that the failure was imminent, but I suppose that's too much to ask.</p><p>Getting my data back was problematic, and it took several boots from an external drive to get the machine to recognize the internal hard drive as being present.  I tried <a href="http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/">Disk Warrior</a> first, but it was completely worthless because it can't recover data from a drive that the OS can't mount!  (Nonetheless, lots of other people seem to have great affection for the tool.)  Next, I tried <a href="http://www.prosofteng.com/products/data_rescue_info.php">Data Rescue II</a>, and that exactly did the trick of getting the files that I needed off of the old drive.  The old drive was in such sorry shape that access times were quite long, so copying 20 gigabytes of data took around six days.</p><p>Getting a replacement drive installed was painless - probably 15 minutes start to finish.  I bought a new <a href="http://www.hitachigst.com/portal/site/en/menuitem.c8c3966a526cfb5deb4703e3aac4f0a0/">Hitachi 7K60</a> and followed the excellent write-up at <a href="http://www.macfixit.com/">MacFixIt</a>.  I also bought a couple of tools from them, since all of my tools were sitting back in Chicago.</p><p>After several attempts at getting a good configuration installed, I have the PowerBook back running again with 10.4.3 just the way I like it.  I have also promised myself to <em>always</em> be disciplined about backups.</p>
