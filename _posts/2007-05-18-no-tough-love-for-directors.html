<p>Interesting <a href="http://www.foundread.com/view/question-of-the-day47">question of the day</a> over on <a href="http://www.foundread.com/">Found+READ</a>:</p>

<blockquote><small>How do I deal with board member whose priorities seem to be diverging from mine and my co-founder&#8217;s at a critical time in the startup&#8217;s life?</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>[...]</small></blockquote>

<blockquote><small>The director is a well-connected investor, so we can&#8217;t afford to alientate him, or anyone else. And I figure if we go head-to-head with him we&#8217;ll lose. (Money talks.) So short of fostering more confrontation/conflict before the board, what can we do? The more time we spend assuaging his concerns, the less time we have for the real work.</small></blockquote>

<p>Seems like an ill-posed question to me, since the director sounds like he's within his bounds.  "Tough love" is not appropriate in this context.  Some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>It's your job to convince the Board that the company is being run properly.</em>  It shouldn't be that difficult or time-consuming to get information in front of the Board about the sales pipeline, state of deals, product status, and burn rate.  In fact, all of that data should be in front of the Board already, so it should be easy for the Directors to assess where the company is headed and when it's likely to arrive.</li>
<li><em>The Board is important.</em>  A dissenting director is not something to be ignored, since the proper functioning of the Board is one of the fundaments of the corporation.  Look at it another way, your shareholders can always sue you, but running your Board by the book makes it less likely that they'll feel a need to and unlikely that they would win.</li>
<li><em>Buy 'em out.</em>  If he's really that worried, get him out at a loss &#8212; have him offer his shares to another investor, have the company buy the shares back, let employees redeem their options, have the management team buy in, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for too many things to do and too little time to do them, welcome to entrepreneurship.</p>
