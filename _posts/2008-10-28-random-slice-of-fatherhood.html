<p>Kid #1 has done a few interesting things lately.</p>

<p>After having trouble with waking up very upset and not able to
explain herself on and off for the past several months, she's talked
to me about a couple of her dreams:</p>

<ul>

<li>A group of friendly giant spiders (the size of dogs) taught her to
climb trees even if there are no branches close to the ground to grab
onto.</li>

<li>A large cricket was poking people, but not in a mean way.  She
accidently broke one of its legs off while dancing around, but it
still kept on poking people.</li>

</ul>

<p>I had been thinking about getting a copy of <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0394815009?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=pbblog-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0394815009">The
Phantom Tollbooth</a> to read with her as a first bedtime story with a
relatively small number of pictures (and because she'd appreciate the
humor in it), but I don't want to inject any more surrealism into her
three-year-old mind.</p>

<p>The other interesting thing is that she's apparently learning to
read.  I was doing some online banking, and she wandered over and
asked me "Why does it say 'bank' up there?"; when I asked where, she
pointed to the word "bank".  This is not entirely surprising, since we
play phonetic games at the dinner table and read to her (by her
request) morning and night, but I wasn't expecting it to start
happening.  The downside is that the wife and I will have to come up
with ways to obfuscate our conversations that don't involve spelling
words.</p>
