<p>Just before JavaOne, I replaced my <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2003/09/17/made-the-move-to-mac">venerable</a> G4 PowerBook with a black MacBook, and I've been pleased with the transition.  (At over three and a half years, the PowerBook had an exceptionally long useful life for a laptop.)  A few observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>A 2.0GHz Core Duo is more than fast enough.  In fact, while I wouldn't have expected it, the MacBook handily beats my 4-way G5 for many development-oriented tasks like builds and starting up IDEA.</li>
<li>Battery life is essentially the same as with the PowerBook, a little over four hours at minimum screen brightness.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>, <tt>rsync</tt>, and the usual downloads (<a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a>, <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>, <a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium</a>) made it quick to get a usable configuration up and running.</li>
<li>Just like the PowerBook, it's too damn hot to be truly used as a laptop without some additional insulation.</li>
<li>The keyboard is odd, doesn't light up, but is otherwise tolerable.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far, so good.</p>
