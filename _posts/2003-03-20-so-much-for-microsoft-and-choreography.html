<p>Microsoft's behavior has always raised questions about their support for standards-based software and interoperability, but Microsoft's departure from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/chor/">WS-Choreography</a> working group at the W3C (see the bottom of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/chor/3/01/17-IPR-statements.html">IPR document</a>) seems to make it clear that they have no interest in harmonizing their pieces of <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-bpel/">BPEL4WS</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/ws-reliablemessaging.asp">WS-ReliableMessaging</a>, and other web services standards with the output of the working group.</p>
