<p>Although I really do like the <a href="http://www.snipsnap.org">SnipSnap</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliki">bliki</a> concept in general, I've decided to move to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">WordPress</a> as a personal publishing medium.  The decision was in large part forced on me by some of SnipSnap's current (0.5.2 as of this writing) foibles (broken calendar, no images in the RSS feeds, inability to authenticate in Firefox, opaque permalinks all named "1", etc.), and in small part because I don't have the time to invest in patching the issues at present.</p>

<p>As for WordPress, other than a little hiccup that was <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/index.php?action=vthread&amp;forum=2&amp;topic=9550&amp;page=-1#post-20">easily</a> resolved, setup was painless.</p>

<p>I haven't decided what I'll do with the <a href="http://blog.fivesight.com/prb/">content</a> in SnipSnap, but I will probably leave it on-line as static content, perhaps migrate it into another wiki (<a href="http://www.instiki.org">Instiki</a> currently has my curiousity up) and start a fresh weblog in WordPress.</p>
