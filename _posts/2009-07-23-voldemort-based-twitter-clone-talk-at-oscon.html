<p><a href="http://netzooid.com">Dan</a> and I just finished up our <a
href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/8362">talk</a>
at OSCON.  You can download the <a
href="http://bit.ly/4dP7zY">slides</a> or <a
href="http://bit.ly/MDyVj">view</a> it on Slideshare.  I'll probably
take it down at some point in the near future, but the sample system
from the presentation is <a href="http://tat1.datapr0n.com:8080">up
and running</a> for the moment.</p>

<p>We got started on the material for the talk several months back
with the Twitter one-to-many publishing problem as a motivating
problem to play with various non-relational data stores, and after
some dabbling with <a href="http://bit.ly/EdUEt">Cassandra</a> and <a
href="http://bit.ly/Zck7F">HBase</a>, we ended up focusing on <a
href="http://bit.ly/ocBX0">Voldemort</a> as an initial backend for the
system.  It is very likely that we'll craft some additional backends,
and I'd particularly like to get to a more forgiving model for storing
lists.  (I'm already part way there on <a
href="http://bit.ly/12AYmf">Dynomite</a> with <a
href="http://bit.ly/BYMdW">Osmos</a> as the storage engine.)</p>

<p>The system described in the talk uses a small (two nodes) Voldemort
cluster and a small cluster of web nodes (JAX-RS with a jQuery
front-end) to implement enough microblogging functionality to be
interesting &#8212; users, follow/followed, publishing &#8212; along
with a simple dashboard implemented with Cacti and rudimentary
deployment automation.  The <a href="http://bit.ly/koe3D">source</a>
is out on GitHub if you want to take a look.  (Feel free to fork with
it...)</p>
