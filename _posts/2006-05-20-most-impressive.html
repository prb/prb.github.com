<p>Via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/05/19/garbage_house_full_o.html">BoingBoing</a>, a <a href="http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&#38;sid=268346">story</a> about a townhouse in Utah where the occupant accumulated ~70,000 empty cans of Coors Light.  (As mentioned in the story, that's a case of beer every day for eight years, although I find it more impressive to think someone drinking a roughly 20 foot by 10 foot, three-foot-deep pool full of beer...)</p>

<p>This reminds me of some silliness from my senior year at <a href="http://www.reed.edu">Reed College</a> where my roommate Nathaniel Thurston and I managed to accumulate 2,248 empty Coke cans over a year's time.  While we were proud of ourselves at the time, it pales in comparison to the guy stockpiling Silver Bullets.  We also made a large &#8220;<a href="http://www.virginia.edu/insideuva/2000/25/index.html">funnelator</a>&#8221; that used two chimneys on the roof of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_College#Dorms">Old Dorm Block</a> as uprights, and I hope that one doesn't get one-upped anytime soon.</p>

<p>On that subject, the dynamics of the &uuml;berfunnelator were interesting.  The balloons often left the &#8220;muzzle&#8221; elongated, and some spun end-over-end stretched out into a dumbbell shape.  I'd be happy to entertain explanations, although my thinking was that the surface of the balloon was sticking to the funnel as the water was thrown forward, resulting in the stretched out shape.</p>
