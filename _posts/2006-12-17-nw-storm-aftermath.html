<p>I took a walk around our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont,_Seattle,_Washington">neighborhood</a> here tonight, and it didn't look like there was much damage other than some limbs down and a couple of smaller trees snapped off.  It was much worse elsewhere in the area and in the city, with flooding, originally ~10<sup>7</sup> people and now down to 10<sup>6</sup> people <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/niffgurd/325489148/">without power</a> in freezing temperatures, and plenty of tree vs. house or tree vs. car mismatches, e.g.:</p>

<p>We're under-prepared, disaster-wise, so this is a wake-up call that I'll answer: generator, fuel, food, and water are all on my shopping list.  This also intensifies my desire to get off the grid, ideally with a set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics">photovoltaic</a> panels on the roof (since we have a large amount of South-facing roof at a good angle) and maybe with an appropriate type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell">fuel cell</a> for additional backup.  </p>
