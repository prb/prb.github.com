<blockquote>On the dynamic language front, the worst code I have seen in my career has always, always, always been in compiled imperative languages, most often Java and C++.</blockquote>

<p>From my perspective, I've had the privilege of seeing some really awful code and design.  The language has always been C/C++ or Java, since that's what virtually all large systems are built in and where there are tools to help people get things written and built.  The root cause for the bad code and design has always been relative ignorance on the part of the developers.  The use of Ruby or Python wouldn't have changed things for the better, while the use of Haskell or Erlang might, purely because I doubt that the developers in question would have been able to get the Haskell or Erlang programs to run...</p>

<p>It shouldn't surprise anyone who took statistics in college that once enough people start using a language, crappy software appears, independent of the language.  With a few liberties taken with respect to hypotheses, it's a consequence of the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CentralLimitTheorem.html">central limit theorem</a>, and this tyranny of the merely average is absolute and inescapable.  It doesn't mean software is any more or less doomed than the rest of our society; rather, it is exactly as doomed as software's reach broadens.</p>
