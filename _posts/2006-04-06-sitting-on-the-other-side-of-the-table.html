<p>Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to sit down with the co-founders of a local startup (non-software) and go through their funding deck, and it was almost as much fun sitting on the (mock) investor's side as on the entrepreneur's side.  Some of the take-aways that came out of the process:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>I'm betting on <u>you</u>.  Tell me how <u>you</u> are going to make the business successful.</em>  If I'm sitting across the table from an entrepreneur who's built a small going concern, the last thing I want is for them to use my money to change horses.  I want to know how my money is going to enable the entrepreneur to scale up first and then how they'll know when they're ready to scale out.</li>

<li><em>You only need a salesforce once you've got a proven, repeatable business model.</em>  Or, to put it another way, &#8220;Show me the collateral!&#8221;  Salespeople drive the sales process, not sales; sales happen as a result of a well-designed sales process.  I want to hear the whole story that starts with the market, how you're going to reach prospects, how you're going to qualify prospects, how you're going to drive the succession of contacts between discovery and closure, and how you're going to ensure that the customer is happy.  I also want to believe that you've got a passion for the data coming out of the process &#8212; when and how do you know if it's working?</li>

<li><em>Be prepared to hit interim milestones if you call them out.</em>  It's great to dangle pending deals from your pipeline in front of your prospective investors, but trying to create urgency this way can backfire on you.  An investor may (quite legitimately) ask you to knock off your next few milestones as proof of your ability to execute on your plan.  If the price goes up appropriately, that's OK, because it's the same investment either way in terms of the price versus probability of success.</li>

<li><em>Why aren't you doing that now?</em>  As you describe your plan, your potential investor is going to stay right with you and potentially get a step ahead.  For example, if you call out a list of potential acquirers and an exit by acquisition, you should expect the question of what you're doing to connect with those companies now and build a relationship.</li>

<li><em>What do you want for yourself and your business?  Are those compatible?</em>  This is a version of the &#8220;comfortable, rich or wealthy?&#8221; <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2005/02/19/the-first-questions-for-every-entrepreneur">question</a> but with a twist.  It's one thing to put a $100M valuation up on a slide, another thing to lay out a plan, and something altogether different to execute on it.  Be very clear and honest with yourself about whether you're the guy with the $100M idea or the guy with the $100M handshake.</li>
</ul>

<p>I claim ownership of none of the ideas above; I learned nearly all of it from my Board, my investors, friendly VCs I've pitched, or from the School of Hard Knocks.</p>
