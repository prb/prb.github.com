<p>Not like the <a href="http://www.paulsimon.com/">Paul Simon</a> <a href="http://music.yahoo.com/track/808354">song</a>.  Like Mr. Truism.  As <a href="http://www.fnokd.com/">Bob</a> <a href="http://www.fnokd.com/2006/07/14/codehaus-basement/">blogged</a>, I've thrown my hat in the ring to help raise some funding for the newly formed Codehaus <a href="http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/Corporations/Corp.aspx?PitemId=7999137">non-profit foundation</a>.  The Codehaus itself has been around in various forms since 2003.</p>

<p>The Haus hosts a <a href="http://www.codehaus.org/Projects">bunch</a> of recognizable projects.  Some of the ones I've found personally useful are <a href="http://jaxen.codehaus.org/">Jaxen</a>, <a href="http://xfire.codehaus.org/">XFire</a>, <a href="http://woodstox.codehaus.org/">Woodstox</a>, <a href="http://stomp.codehaus.org/">Stomp</a> (:ttmp), and <a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty6/">Jetty6</a>.  There were <a href="http://www.fnokd.com/2006/05/15/its-going-around/">issues</a> with the Haus's hardware back in May, and Bob, Ben, and others put in a Herculean effort to get things back to a reasonable state of <a href="http://www.fnokd.com/2006/05/25/sanity-slight-return/">sanity</a>.  (New hosting and bandwidth provided by <a href="http://www.contegix.com/index.action">Contegix</a> are a step in the right direction.)</p>

<p>The goal for the funding is simple &#8212; Ensure that the Codehaus continues to be a great place to make software.  Less process than Apache, more infrastructure than Sourceforge, and a vibrant community.  There are always plenty of people out on the <a href="irc://irc.codehaus.org/codehaus">stoop</a>.</p>
