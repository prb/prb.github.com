<p>I wanted a visual representation of the usual <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continued_fraction">continued
fraction</a> expansion of the irrational number <code>e</code> that
used concentric rings to represent the successive anapests of the tail
of the expansion; with grouping added for emphasis:</p>

<blockquote><p>2, 1,1,2, 1,1,4, 1,1,6, ...</p></blockquote>

<p>The first ring would have four sectors; the second would have six,
the third eight, etc.  Something like this:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://mult.ifario.us/images/e_rings.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The question was how to get it drawn, and after a little thought, I
settled on writing a <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>
program to generate the image.  The language doesn't include a
primitive for drawing sectors, but it's possible to represent a second
as a larger filled arc and then a smaller filled arc that covers the
same angle but filled with background color:</p>

<pre class="code">fill(foreground);
arc(x0,y0,r1,r1,theta0,theta1);
fill(background);
arc(x0,y0,r0,r0,theta0,theta1);</pre>

<p>Or, in my case, just stacking up pie charts with the smallest on
top is sufficient.  The source is <a
