<p>Yesterday, we had the 20-week ultrasound for what, with luck, will be our second child.  The news was good: fingers, toes, arms, legs, nose, heart, kidneys, etc., all present and accounted for in the usual quantities.</p>

<p>The first pregnancy was textbook normal, but we had a bit of a scare early on with this one in the form of a statistically abnormal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuchal_translucency">nuchal translucency</a> (NT).  NT is computed as a ratio between measurements in an ultrasound, and large ratios are correlated to trisomic chromosomal abnormalities like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome">Down Syndrome</a>.  We went ahead with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorionic_villus_sampling">chorionic villus sampling</a> (CVS), and the results showed no abnormalities.  It was a long couple of weeks waiting for information after the NT result.</p>

<p>Looking at the prospect of testing, the amount of hard information available to the prospective parent is limited, even from a "genetic counselor" or physician.  I asked about statistics and studies around NT and CVS, and the best that the caregiver could manage were the usual statistics &#8212; without even the false positive rate!  I'm more interested in looking at the actual studies and statistics than most folks probably would be, but I don't think it's too much to ask people to give correct explanations and provide reference materials.  Come to think of it, I'd like to see <em>all</em> scientific and medical research data available as open source (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC By-SA</a>, perhaps?) and freely available on-line.  (It looks like this is aligned with the mission of the <a href="http://sciencecommons.org/">Science Commons</a>.)</p>
