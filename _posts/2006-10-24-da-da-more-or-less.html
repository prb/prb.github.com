<p>The kid has started talking in earnest.  She started using a few made-up words for things ("mum mum" was food, "boo-ey" was book) as much as a year ago, but now she understands dozens of words and uses a few dozen &#8212; car, baby, cookie, etc. &#8212; that are close enough to pass for the real thing.  This morning, she started saying "da da" to refer to me, which was a nice way to kick off the day.</p>

<p>Tonight, she pointed out a package of Brawny paper towels.  The strapping, flannel-clad man on the package is "Dada".  (I'll admit a certain resemblance, at least in wardrobe.)  Then Paul Allen is on the cover of Seattle magazine, and he's "Dada", too.  Who knows how many other Dada's could be lurking around...?  I'm sure that we can get a finer point on just who "Da da" is and isn't in a couple of days, and it's good be one her Dadas at any rate.</p>
