<p>The only thing that I lost in the transition between <a
href="http://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">readline</a>
in GHC 6.8 and <a href="http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/">editline</a>
in GHC 6.10 was backwards history search in <code>ghci</code> bound to
<code>^R</code>.  I use that particular feature quite a bit, so that
had a big negative impact on my productivity.</p>

<p>Here's how to get it back.  Create a file in your home directory
called <code>.editrc</code> with the following contents:</p>

<pre class="code">edit on
bind ^R em-inc-search-prev</pre>

<p>The analogous setting for forward search (<code>bind ^S
em-inc-search-next</code>) doesn't work for some reason, but that's
not one that I'm going to miss.</p>
