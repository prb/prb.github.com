<p>Every so often, I'm away from my primary home machine (accessible via secure shell on a non-standard port) and I want to shut down Mail or Adium or RemoteDesktop or some other application.  The following hack provides a more graceful shutdown than a <code>kill</code> from the commandline:</p>

<pre class="code">$ osascript
tell application "Mail"
        quit
end
&lt;CTRL-D></pre>

<p>Where the <code>"Mail"</code> could be <code>"Adium"</code> or whatever.</p>
