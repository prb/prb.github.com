<p>The two <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0963488406?tag=pbblog-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0963488406&amp;adid=0MJFV31258082CBTSMY9&amp;">heaviest</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0387245448?tag=pbblog-20&amp;camp=14573&amp;creative=327641&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0387245448&amp;adid=1RAYFGY30DF03Q5ZN2CJ&amp;">books</a> that have been on my nightstand in the past few months are about conveying information graphically, and it's a an area where I think that there is room for innovation.  (The room for innovation is not in presentation of data but in interpretation of data.)  On the subject of data visualization and interpretation, <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/">Paul Kedrosky</a> <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/04/24/if_youre_so_dum.html">cited</a> a graph from a forthcoming academic paper that conveys an apparent lack of correlation between intelligence (measured by an IQ test) and wealth, and the graphic makes an interesting object lesson.  I'm going to criticize the graphic without any context from the article.  I'd argue that it's not an unfair thing to do, as a graphic (along with any legends and labels) should be self-contained.</p>

<p>Without further ado, here's the graphic:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pkedrosky/472069325/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/229/472069325_d9b40ca0c6_m.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>A first observation is that young and highly educated people (and thus likely high IQ in the form of high scores on standardized tests that would have been used for college and graduate admissions) are likely to have negative net worth in the form of student loans and recent mortgages on expensive housing.  The most expensive housing is in locations that attract the educated &#8212; New York, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco &#8212; and the size of the mortgage will be correlated to apparent earning potential.  Real estate as a component of net worth would also impact the graph based on the age of the individual, as folks now in their 50's and 60's were able to afford homes that would be out of their reach (for the same career) now.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see the same graph with some added color, e.g., dots colored by income or by education and sized by age.  It would also be interesting to see the graph broken up into subsets by age and by geography.  For instance, I imagine that smarter, younger people in the Valley are richer than elsewhere.  Maybe researchers can still include a few choice charts in their publications but make data available on <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/app">Many Eyes</a> or as interactive <a href="http://benfry.com/salaryper/">tools</a> built around libraries like <a href="http://prefuse.org/">Prefuse</a> or <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>.  (btw, if Many Eyes isn't enough, you can get more kid-in-an-eye-candy-store experience at <a href="http://www.visualcomplexity.com/vc/">VisualComplexity.com</a>.)  If I ever get a Windows machine at home, it would be interesting to turn <a href="http://www.tableausoftware.com/">Tableau</a> loose on a more complete set of data for the IQ study.  (The free and very good <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HippoDraw">HippoDraw</a> can be <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/grp/ek/hippodraw/install_mac_root.html">made to work</a> on MacOS, but it's not as pretty or capable as Tableau.)</p>
