Starting last weekend, the server that hosts the virtual server that
hosts this blog has been up and down, and then last night, it went
down for the count.  <a href="http://www.linode.com">Linode</a>, which
I've been using since October 2006, has been a great hosting provider
so far &#8212; this has been the only meaningful hiccup, and they dealt
with it quick and transparently.  The virtual server is back up on a
new physical server, so I'm looking forward to another trouble-free
couple of years.</p>

<p>Things are back to normal:</p>
