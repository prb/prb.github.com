<p>The mantra "reduce, reuse, recycle" is in my head from someplace, and maybe it comes from growing up in a house where we put out a couple of cans of garbage per year.  Recycling has a green halo, but it's not as important as reduce or reuse.  The best possible thing is simply <em>not</em> to consume in the first place other than to meet your realistic needs, and reuse comes second.  Recycling is a distant third because it consumes resources &#8212; items must be collected and processed before being used as raw materials for something new.  Not everyone can be <a href="http://noimpactman.typepad.com/blog/">no-impact-man</a> (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/garden/22impact.html?ex=1175400000&amp;en=ef0573552e3a63f4&amp;ei=5070">NYT</a>, registration required), but I'm not even going to list "just throwing things away" as a choice.  (Here in the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/">Emerald City</a>, it's <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/util/About_SPU/Recycling_System/History_&amp;_Overview/Ban_on_Recyclables_in_Garbage/index.asp">illegal</a>.)</p>

<p>Any health considerations of the CD spindle case aside (see <a href="http://reddit.com/info/1fhyr/comments">thread</a> on reddit, or <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070406.wbisphenolA0407/BNStory/Front/?pageRequested=all">read</a> <a href="http://www.billingsgazette.net/articles/2007/04/06/news/local/20-estrogen.txt">elsewhere</a> on why plastic is the new lead), packaging is wasteful, and there should be a way to reuse it.</p>

<p>For example, I've wondered about the economics of an old school glass milk bottle-style exchange system applied to restaurant take-out containers.  (For younger readers, the milk bottle system worked like this: pay $1 for a heavy glass milk bottle once, bring it back to the store when empty, pay for new milk and trade for a new bottle; the dairy cleans and refills the bottles, etc.)  The consumer would pay a non-refundable deposit (e.g., $15) on the take-out containers, and old containers could be traded for new.  The little details include what the containers would be made of, how they could be  cleaned, what inventories would have to be like for a restaurant in terms of different sizes and form factors, and of course, whether consumers would go for it.  There is also the question of whether or not reuse of glass containers (with the initial cost of manufacturing and ongoing impact of water use, detergents, transportation, etc.) would be lower-impact than single-use paper containers.  The lightweight DIY version would be to bring empty containers to the restaurant to be filled, but that doesn't work with phone or delivery orders.</p>
