<p>It's time for predictions, resolutions, and retrospectives. My one-sentence plan for 2004 is <em>Do less and accomplish more</em>.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0887306128">The Effective Executive</a> (which is older than I am) by <a href="http://www.peter-drucker.com/">Peter Drucker</a>:</p>

<blockquote>If there is any one &#8220;secret&#8221; of effectiveness, it is concentration. Effective executives do first things first and they do one thing at a time. [...] [T]o get even that half-day or those two weeks of really productive time requires self-discipline and an iron determination to say &#8220;No.&#8221;</blockquote>
