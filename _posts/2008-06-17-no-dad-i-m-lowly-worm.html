<p>Kid #1 is doing well enough that sometimes I forget that she's just
a little over three years old, but then she'll whip out a malaprop or
mangle an idiom to remind me. For example, while she was explaining to
me that she was Lowly Worm and I was Huckle the Cat, she tripped and
fell flat on her face, and the following conversation ensued:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Dad:</em> Whoa!  Are you alright?</p>
<p><em>Kid #1:</em> No, Dad!  [somewhat exasperated]  I'm Lowly Worm...</p></blockquote>
