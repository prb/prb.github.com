<p>The wife and I try to put on the dog and get out for a good meal once a month, leaving the kid home with a babysitter.  In my case, "dog" means a shirt with buttons and a pair of shoes that aren't <a href="http://www.birkenstock.com/">Birkenstocks</a>, but the scene in Seattle is decidedly casual, anyway.  We've got a preference for tasting menus and local ingredients, and Seattle restaurants have been good to us so far.</p>

<p>The places that we'd go back to, with links and comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.rovers-seattle.com/"><em>Rover's</em></a>.  Northwest cuisine with a French accent and inspired wine pairings (e.g., a white burgundy with lobster and beets).  We went for one of the pre-set d&eacute;gustations, but Rover's is the only restaurant I've seen that lets people mix-and-match off of tasting menus.  Like lots of restaurants in Seattle, no valet parking.</li>
<li><a href=""><em>Canlis</em></a>.  Impeccable service (they do a no-claim-check valet service where your car is waiting for you when you walk out) and solid if a bit traditional menu.  We inadvertently ordered too much food because the portions were larger than we expected.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/food/restaurants/legourmand.php"><em>Le Gourmand</em></a>.  More seasonal Northwest cuisine with a French edge.  We happened to go during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morel">morel</a> season, and a big, saucy plateful with some venison as a garnish was part of the meal.  If his reputation holds, the morels were probably gathered by the chef himself.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sitkaandspruce.com/"><em>Sitka &amp; Spruce</em></a>.  Creative small plates, local seasonal ingredients, and a chalkboard menu on the wall in a tiny space.  Here's a <a href="http://seattle.metblogs.com/archives/2006/05/eastside_eats_s.phtml">nice review</a> with pictures in a local "metroblog".</li>
<li><a href="http://www.elementalatgasworks.com/"><em>Elemental</em></a>.  Small plates with a fun "skip the menu and just bring me some food and wine" guessing game d&eacute;gustation.  The only negative with the meal was that the pairings included full glasses of wine, so we left both stuffed and stupefied.  Like Sitka &amp; Spruce, Elemental is tiny (~20 seats), and fills the tables for a first seating promptly at 5:30PM.  (We got turned away once by arriving at 5:35...)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://www.theherbfarm.com">Herb Farm</a> for a game-centric menu is up next.</p>
