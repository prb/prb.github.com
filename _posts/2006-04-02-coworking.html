<blockquote>What&#8217;s coworking?  I think of it as your favorite wifi coffeehouse, but with paid membership, more explicit community, and focus on project work and collaboration.</blockquote>

<p>After a quick look at the <a href="http://coworking.pbwiki.com/">coworking wiki</a>, I'd probably give it a shot if I were doing independent consulting.  (Nonetheless, it doesn't look like there's anyone doing something similar in Seattle, at least by that name.)  A cafe where I had a guaranteed table, a properly trained barrista on-call, bottomless americanos, some white noise, ample power, wifi, and a couple of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/p-r-b/17111357/in/set-334095/">cellular phone booths</a> would make an attractive work environment even without the possibility of collaboration and conversation.</p>
