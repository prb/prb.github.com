title: "Bright Eyes and Hiring"

<p>I've been spending time on airplanes lately, so I'm slowly getting caught up on my weblog reading queue.  I recently dequeued Paul Graham's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html">note</a> on hiring, and it reminds me of my <a href="http://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=452">advisor</a>'s metric -- whether a person has "bright eyes" (or not).</p>

<p>Assessing the brightness of someone's eyes has numerous advantages over degrees (which must be bought -- with tuition if nothing else -- and can be lied about), letters of recommendation (which are always guarded and almost always positive), references (which are selected to create a positive image), standardized test scores (which measure standardized capabilities), or other standard metrics; not the least of these is that it's an <em>inclusive</em> measurement as opposed to an <em>exclusive</em> measurement.</p>

<p>The downside of using ocular luminescence in hiring decisions is that it requires both talking and listening to candidates, so it's impossible to apply to a large applicant pool.  It is a reasonable measure to apply to a small, pre-culled pool, but the probability is large that pre-processing already culled a number of bright-eyed candidates.</p>

<p>At least in my experience, bushy tails are irrelevant to hiring decisions...</p>
