<p>When negotiating with a potential customer, it's tempting to offer
things that you think will make them take the deal. This is wrong for
two reasons.</p>

<p>First, what <em>you</em> think will make them take the deal and
what <em>they</em> actually want may be different, so you're making a
concession that doesn't help your cause. Worse than that, you run the
risk of confusing a less savvy customer who will then try to
understand the enlarged deal terms or showing a more savvy customer
that you're desperate.</p>

<p>Second, you always want the simplest, most uniform deals possible.
Repeatability is scalability for the organization, and a one-off deal
proves nothing about a product or business model. (Bending &#8212; but
not breaking &#8212; the rules for a <em>big</em> deal is acceptable.)
Moreover, having a limited number of form agreements greatly
simplifies due diligence for financing or acquisition.</p>
