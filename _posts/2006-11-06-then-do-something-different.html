<p><a href="http://www.wgrosso.com/">Bill Grosso</a> pointed me at <a href="http://www.heavenstone.us/">Mark Himelstein</a>'s book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0741427397/">100 Questions to Ask Your Software Organization</a>", and I've been surprised not to find more mentions of the book or Mark's <a href="http://heavenstone.typepad.com/heavenstone_inc/">blog</a> out in the blogosphere.  (That said, he as an accomplished VP of <em>Engineering</em>, not <em>Marketing</em>.)  The book is a little rough around the edges, but it's a very realistic picture of what it means to lead a software organization.  It's a good exercise to take a question a day and honestly assess how you've dealt with it.  Especially in a context where you don't have more experienced leaders to learn from, forced introspection is valuable.</p>

<p>A recent blog entry from Mark reminded me of one of the most difficult things about being a leader, which is being wrong:</p>

<blockquote><small>When an organization is facing challenges around meeting their commitments, hiring goals, retention goals, and quality goals it is often suggested that teams improve their processes.  While I have seldom seen teams succeed without processes, I have seen numerous teams fail with them. In my mind they are required but they are not sufficient. In the end, competent and courageous leadership will win the day.</small></blockquote>

<p>I've seen the inappropriate emphasis on "how" instead of "what" in companies large and small.  If what you're doing isn't working, then you need to do something different.  In metaphorical terms, it's not a question of your velocity, attitude, hairstyle, or the angle of incidence of your head with the brick wall &#8212; recognize and acknowledge that it's a brick wall and find a way over or around rather than try to go through and dragging your organization along with you.  (Or, for that matter, find a way to use the brick wall in your favor; a barrier to execution can turn into a advantage if you're able to use it against your competitors.)  The right amount of process is the least amount of rigidity that ensures that good information flows up to the leadership and that the effectiveness of changes in direction can be quickly and objectively assessed.</p>

<p>As to the right kinds and levels of processes, two key challenges come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Select the right metrics for the goals.</em>  Hard, quantitative measurements recorded regularly are a must, but it takes discipline to ensure that those measurements have a causal relationship with the goals at hand.  Is reducing bug counts going to enhance engineer morale?  Is marketing effectiveness going to enhance sales effectiveness, or is the pipeline kinked-up elsewhere?</li>
<li><em>Ensure that locality of action and locality of information coincide.</em>  A well-factored organization has the same smell as a well-factored API, and no process should involve information and decisions moving across more than one tier at a time.  Should an executive care what flavor of XP a particular team is using?  Absolutely not, other than to ensure that the experiences of that lead/manager are disseminated to others.  Should an executive carefully review deliverable definitions, ruthlessly track progress, and drive consensus between the teams that collaborate on a product?  Absolutely.  Effective processes preserve the autonomy and cleverness of people at different levels in the organization, and if your organization lacks that kind of trust, then gut it &#8212; you have the wrong people.</li>
</ul>
