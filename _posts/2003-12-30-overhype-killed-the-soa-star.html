<p>As I've <a href="http://blog.prb.io/the-prisoners-dilemna-and-post-bubble-software-sales.html">commented </a> before, setting unreasonable expectations is one of the biggest risks for service-oriented architecture (or BPM or...), and some people are already looking at &#8220;service-oriented&#8221; as a <a href="http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/originalContent/0,289142,sid26_gci942252,00.html">dirty word.</a></p>

<p>From a recent <a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/">LooselyCoupled</a> blog <a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/2003_12_28_lc.htm#107280266015581527">entry</a>:</p>

<blockquote>The first signs that the initial peak of hype is approaching comes when analysts begin predicting massive market growth. So <a href="http://www.zapthink.com/">ZapThink</a>'s latest prediction, <a href="http://www.crn.com/sections/BreakingNews/dailyarchives.asp?ArticleID=46854">released</a> as news just before Christmas, that the service oriented architecture market will reach &#8220;$43 billion by 2010&#8221;, is a sure sign that the current passion for SOA is about to turn sour.</blockquote>

<p>Phil Wainewright is dead-on about semantic integration, repository/discovery, service assembly, and skills/practices as the missing pieces, and these are challenges that are neither new nor unique to service-oriented architecture.</p>

<p>Is the $43B number reasonable? I haven't read the ZapThink report, but if you believe a $150B total size for the 2004 enterprise software marketplace (databases, application servers, ERP/MRP, ...) and assume an aggressive 7% annual rate of growth over the next seven years, that puts 2010's enterprise software market at around $225B. The $43B would be 19%.</p>

<p>That 7% number may be overly aggressive. Versus 2002, the 2003 revenues of the Software Magazine <a href="http://www.softwaremag.com/SW500/index.cfm">Software500</a> (registration required) actually <a href="http://www.softwaremag.com/L.cfm?Doc=2003-12/2003-12software500">slipped 4%</a> from $301.8B to $289.7B. The Software500 numbers include services as well, so while the number is not a pure measurement of the enterprise software licensing marketplace, it is a very accurate measurement of the overall marketplace for software and services. It might not be unreasonable to assume that the Software500 represents a roughly stable market at around $300B, in which case the $43B would represent 14.3% of the total market.</p>

<p>I am willing to believe that SOA will find its way into 14-19% of the software market, but I don't think it will represent a distinguishable segment of the future market any more than any technique or approach (e.g., XML or object-oriented programming) represents a distinguishable segment of the current market.</p>
