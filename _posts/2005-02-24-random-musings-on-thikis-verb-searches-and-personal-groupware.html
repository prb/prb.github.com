<p>Collaboration and "groupware" are justifiably hot, since most of the current offerings <em>suck</em>, and every company and working person are potential customers of something that's truly better.  I'm doing my best to keep track of <a href="http://www.jotspot.com">JotSpot</a>, <a href="http://hula-project.org/Hula_Server">Hula</a>, and whatever <a href="http://labs.google.com/">Google</a> decides to do in the way of a <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/004282.html">calendar</a>.  (Hey, Yahoo, how about supporting calendaring standards before Google eats your lunch (again)?)  Nonetheless, there is still something missing.</p>

<p>I need software that helps me collaborate with myself, and one thought is to have a "thicki" that cuts across applications and rolls in some combination of desktop search and backlinking functionality.  (A "thicki" is a wiki with a thick client instead of a web client.)   I'd like to be able to attach the notes from a meeting to the calendar event for that meeting to the attendees to all of the emails that I've ever sent...  (Hard-core text UI folks may recall Emacs <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/PlannerMode">PlannerMode</a>.)</p>

<p>In this vein, I've been experimenting with a simple thiki called <a href="http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/">VoodooPad</a> for note-taking and doodling.  VoodooPad has some nice goodies in it like a little sketchpad.  It's still short of what I'd like in terms of hooks into other applications, but you can hardly blame VoodooPad for the the under-instrumentation of other applications and the operating system...</p>

<p>On the subject of hooks into other applications, there is a fabulous tool for Mac OS X called <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a>.  The best way I can describe it is an autocomplete search engine for application <em>verbs</em> (i.e., scripting hooks).  The way it works is that you trigger the agent via a gesture or key combination and then it proposes matches for what you type next.  (For example, with my configuration, I type <tt>[ALT]</tt> <tt>[ALT]</tt> <tt>pause</tt> <tt>[ENTER]</tt> to pause iTunes playing.  Or, <tt>[ALT]</tt> <tt>[ALT]</tt> <tt>mail</tt> <tt>[ENTER]</tt> brings Mail.app to the foreground.)</p>

<p>Some combination of VoodooPad and Quicksilver may be what I'm after, e.g., <tt>[20050224]</tt> in a thiki page is a link to that day in iCal or <tt>[Paul Brown]</tt> brings up a list of options like "find all references to Paul Brown in other thiki pages", "find all emails from Paul Brown", "open Paul Brown in AddressBook", "dial Paul Brown on T616 via bluetooth", etc.</p>
