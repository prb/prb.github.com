<p>While I was neither at the table nor a fly on the wall, I claim that the investment thesis for <a href="http://www.jboss.com">JBoss</a> was straightforward -- <em>Surely there's some way to make money on 30% marketshare.</em>  And while some of the <a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=33830">analysis</a> of IBM's <a href="http://yahoo.reuters.com/financeQuoteCompanyNewsArticle.jhtml?duid=mtfh65519_2005-05-10_12-32-13_n10729375_newsml">purchase</a> of GlueCode focuses on open source, I expect that the investment thesis was as simple and pragmatic as the one I imagine for the JBoss investment -- <em>Surely there's some way to make money by using the Apache brand to drive business through the IBM services channel.</em>  (IBM already gives their software (a.k.a. "serviceware") away to drive the services channel, so it's not about free software.)</p>
