<p>I like <a href="http://fantasticcontraption.com/">Fantastic
Contraption</a> because solving the puzzles requires a fundamental
type of cleverness, intuition, and experimentalism.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://FantasticContraption.com/?designId=848432"><img alt="contraption to roll a ball" src="http://blog.prb.io/files/contraption_roller.png" /></a>&#160;<a href="http://FantasticContraption.com/?designId=707255"><img alt="contraption to climb a shaft" src="http://blog.prb.io/files/contraption_climber.png" /></a></p>

<p>Something like Fantastic Contraption &#8212; but not Fantastic
Contraption because everyone and their dog has played it at this point
&#8212; would make an interesting adjunct to the traditional battery
of questions in engineering interviews. (Yes, I saw <a
href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087597/">Last Starfighter</a> once
upon a time. No, not in the theater.) The usual questions
about data structures, algorithms, tools/practices, and design do a
reasonable job of filtering candidates, but it can be like chewing a
mouthful of saltine crackers for the interviewers after the
N<sup>th</sup> time through. A game might make it a bit more fun for
folks on both sides of the table.</p>
