<p>As a heavy GMail user, I see a lot of Google ads.  I <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2006/09/28/the-adsense-magic-8-ball">used to</a> enjoy the relatively random nature of the ads, but now I just wish I didn't see the same ads over and over again.  If Google is going to track my online behavior, then maybe after the 1,000<sup>th</sup> impression they'd get the hint that I don't want to work for them in Bangalore and stop showing me that ad...  (Advertisements for jobs at Google are the primary offender, actually.)</p>
