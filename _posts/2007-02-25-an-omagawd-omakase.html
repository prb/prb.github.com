<p>As our monthly attempt to get a good meal, the wife and I went to <a href="http://www.nishinorestaurant.com/">Nishino</a> for a "deluxe" eight-course omakase on Saturday, and other than the dessert, it did not disappoint.  The dessert could be described as a tempura banana split, and while that sounds like it could be good, it wasn't.  The rest of the meal was so good that we didn't care about dessert.  Most of the courses had a Japanese-French mash-up feel to it with amazing sashimi paired with good sauces (red wine reduction with tuna, foie gras, and shitake mushroom) or simple garnishes (amberjack with jalapeno, ginger salsa, and a garlic chip).  The straight-ahead nigiri course was excellent, with literally the best o-toro that I've ever had and some sawara that was even smoother and butterier.  (I'm a little unclear on the sawara (<a href="http://www.oceansalive.org/eat.cfm?subnav=fishpage&amp;fish=60">spanish mackerel</a>) versus aji (horse mackerel), since our server said both "aji" and "spanish mackerel" &#8212; either way, those were really amazing pieces of fish, mercury risk aside.)  Speaking as someone who used to regularly travel to Japan, this was great sushi; we're definitely going back.</p>
