<p>Sometimes you lose track of people, and that's been the case with me, as I've left behind various friends and contacts each time I changed geography (Portland, Bay Area, Chicago), but then you run into people again.</p>

<p>Bowman Hastie, with whom I had a short-lived but productive musical collaboration (MC Extra Cheese and DJ PRB &#8212; sorry no MP3's available) over a decade ago when we both lived in Portland, OR, has a dog named <a href="http://www.tillamookcheddar.com/">Tillamook Cheddar</a> who is an internationally renowned artist.</p>

<p>Cool.</p>

<p>This reminds me of good advice I got from an experienced entrepreneur about investor pitches for technical products: Start out with something easy to understand; think about how to tell your Mom (or Dad) what you do. Promoting a painting dog would make perfect sense to my parents, but I'm still working on a parent-friendly, cocktail-party-suitable explanation of why a BPEL engine is important.</p>
