<p>The kid has been demonstrating pretty much full comprehension of verbal instructions and basic predicates ("if", "before", "after", etc.) from me and/or the wife, which is very, very nice: "If you want more crackers, take your snack trap and ask your mother."  Her ability to express herself isn't as far along, but she is picking up a couple of new words each day.  The most interesting thing that she did recently was to randomly interject words while I was humming the theme for a DVD that she'd watched.  So I hummed it again.  Same words.  It took me a minute, but I figured out that she was describing the scenes that went along with the intro music, more or less at the right point.  Note to self to be very careful about what I say around her and what she sees.  Nonetheless, it's easy for me to slip and forget how the kid might see situations.</p>

<p>Today, we were looking at the iPhone pages at Apple.com together, and we watched the video clip of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/">The Office</a>.  The basic plot synopsis was that Guy A was playing jokes on Guy B by sending Guy B faxes ostensibly from himself in the future, and the current fax was a warning that the coffee was poisoned.  In possession of this information, Guy B saw Guy C about to drink some coffee, ran over screaming "Noooooooo", and slapped the coffee out of Guy C's hand.  I had a good laugh.  The kid was scared out of her wits and didn't stop hugging me until we went to see the wife...  Oops.</p>
