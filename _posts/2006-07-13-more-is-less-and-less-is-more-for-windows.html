<p><a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/">Jon</a> is <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2006/07/13.html#a1485">writing</a> simple text in full screen, and <a href="http://beust.com/">Cedric</a>'s <a href="http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000394.html">trying</a> (<a href="http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000398.html">really</a>) to get comfortable with managing windows on Mac OS.  <a href="http://www.43folders.com/">Merlin Mann</a> has been regularly <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/11/15/fake-fullscreen/">riffing</a> <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/01/23/full-screen/">about</a> simplifying window management and increasing focus by <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/07/05/megazoomer/">getting away</a> from multiple open apps.  Little bits of chrome and a few icons aren't that distracting for me, so I'm happy with my version of simple text in full screen, which is <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a> with a nice theme and all other applications <em>hidden</em>.  (<a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom">WriteRoom</a> apparently doesn't work on two-headed environments anyway, as it only blacks-out the primary display.)</p>

<p>Being disciplined about keeping non-foreground apps hidden is key.  If I want a different application, I hide the one I'm working in (<tt>CMD-h</tt>), call-up <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> (<tt>ALT-ALT</tt>), and type the name of the application that I want to either un-hide or start.  To paraphrase Bob Marley, no mousin', no cry.  As the screenshot suggests, that means that my extra display is little more than a fancy picture frame a good amount of the time, although it's quite useful for reference material in a browser or PDF viewer if I'm writing code (as opposed to prose).</p>

<p>On the topic of multiple monitors, via <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/dual-monitor/dual-monitors-increase-productivity-168488.php">Lifehacker</a>, an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/20/technology/20basics.html?ei=5090&amp;en=6fc17b9bf54ea2ef&amp;ex=1303185600&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1145537733-/Kdyvqpu0/eVBVNBYUcsqg">article</a> in the New York Times about multi-monitor setups:</p>

<blockquote>Survey after survey shows that whether you measure your productivity in facts researched, alien spaceships vaporized, or articles written, adding an extra monitor will give your output a considerable boost &#8212; 20 percent to 30 percent, according to a survey by Jon Peddie Research.</blockquote>

<p>The actual <a href="http://www.jonpeddie.com/special/MultDisp.shtml">study</a> cites a 42% average increase in productivity, and I have to say that I'm incredulous but not sufficiently curious to pay for the report.</p>
