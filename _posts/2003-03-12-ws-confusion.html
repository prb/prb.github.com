<p>To complement the <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/wsrm/">Web Services Reliable Messaging</a> specification currently in-progress in OASIS, Microsoft, IBM, BEA, and TIBCO just released <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/ws-reliablemessaging.asp">WS-ReliableMessaging</a>. (The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnglobspec/html/ws-addressing.asp">WS-Addressing</a> specification is in the same salvo, presumably to supply unambiguous identification of endpoints for the purpose of tracking acknowledgements.) The OASIS version (which I mentioned <a href="http://blog.prb.io/ws-reliability-the-latest-installment-in-ws-everything.html">earlier</a> in my weblog) was initially publicized as "WS-Reliability".</p>

<p>The OASIS version is backed (in terms of <a href="http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/tc-announce/200302/msg00011.html">initial committee membership</a>) by Hitachi, Fujitsu, WebMethods, Sonic Software, NEC, Oracle, IONA, SeeBeyond, WRQ, SAP, and Sun. The other version is backed (in terms of authorship) by IBM, Microsoft, BEA, and TIBCO.</p>

<p>The kicker in the Microsoft/IBM/TIBCO version is, as expected:</p>

<blockquote><small>EXCEPT FOR THE COPYRIGHT LICENSE GRANTED ABOVE [to reproduce the specification document], THE AUTHORS DO NOT GRANT, EITHER EXPRESSLY OR IMPLIEDLY, A LICENSE TO ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING PATENTS, THEY OWN OR CONTROL.</small></blockquote>

<p>(Is "impliedly" a word?)  OASIS has some more reasonable <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/who/intellectualproperty.shtml">IP terms</a>.  At any rate, I'm not sure what "intellectual property" IBM/Microsoft/TIBCO could possibly be referring to (other than potentially spurrious patents), since sequence numbers, acknowledgements, endpoint identification, and timeouts are part of more messaging and communications protocols in the network domain, Internet domain (SMTP), and business domain (HL7, EDI, EDI-INT, etc.) than I could count.</p>
