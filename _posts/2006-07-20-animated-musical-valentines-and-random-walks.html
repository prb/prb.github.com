<p>Kids are fascinated by cell phones.  Just ask <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/mac/0,70538-1.html?tw=wn_story_page_next1">Woz</a>.  We regularly let the kid play with our cell phones under the assumption that she can do no harm.  The camera is a hit, she regularly surfs around the web, and given enough time, she usually changes the ringtone to something silly.  (I like my phone to sound like a phone.)  She mostly uses her thumbs, so these are the things that are reachable with random sequences of the buttons on the keypad that are within reach.  Even if she did manage to call Timbuktu, I'm willing to pay a couple bucks for a quick and peaceful diaper change.</p>

<p>The other night, she was playing with the phone during a diaper change, and it rang.  I answered, and the person on the other end of the phone demanded to know &#8220;Who is this?&#8221;  I responded with something along the lines of &#8220;Surely you know, since <em>you</em> called <em>me</em>.&#8221;  After a couple more exchanges, we recognized each other.  He explained that I'd sent him an animated musical valentine, and we all had a good laugh.</p>

<p>With enough poking around, I figured out how she did it.  Maybe it's time to get a <a href="http://www.leapfrog.com/do/findproduct?id=leapster">Leapster</a>.  Or maybe it's time for someone to design a phone with a &#8220;baby mode&#8221; that disables external communications until an unthumbable code is entered.</p>
