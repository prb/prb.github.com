<p>The old version of <a
href="http://blog.fivesight.com/prb">pbblog</a> got hammered with
around 5,000 hits in under an hour this morning from some spammer
trying to generate referrer links.  That kind of load is neither
healthy for the Jetty instance hosting it nor for the <a
href="http://www.johncompanies.com">virtual server</a> it's running
on, and it's not the kind of thing I'd like to burn bandwidth and CPU
on.  (5,000 hits times 20k = 100M.)  SnipSnap already provides <a
href="http://snipsnap.org/comments/SnipSnap/blacklist/referrer">blacklist</a>
functionality (<a
href="http://blog.fivesight.com/prb/space/Snipsnap/blacklist/referrer">here</a>'s
my blacklist), but that doesn't prevent the request from being
serviced.</p>

<p>The thing to do is intercept the undesired traffic at the Apache
proxy.  I used to have the standard Apache <code>mod_proxy</code>
setup as <a
href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-5.0-doc/proxy-howto.html">recommended</a>
by Tomcat, but <code>mod_rewrite</code> can provide the same
functionality (presuming that <code>mod_proxy</code> is
installed):</p>

<pre class="code">&lt;VirtualHost *&gt;
  ServerName blog.fivesight.com
  &lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
    RewriteEngine On
    [... RewriteMap declarations go here ...]
    [... RewriteCond entries for badly behaved REMOTE_HOST,
         REMOTE_ADDR, HTTP_USER_AGENT, and HTTP_REFERER go
         here ...]
    RewriteRule ^.*$ - [F,L]
    RewriteRule ^/prb$ /prb/
    RewriteRule ^prb/(.*)$ http://127.0.0.1:xxxx/prb/$1 [P,L]
    RewriteRule ^.+$ http://www.fivesight.com [R]
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</pre>

<p>The line that ends with <code>[P,L]</code> replaces the
<code>ProxyPass</code> and <code>ProxyPassReverse</code> entries that
would be used with <code>mod_proxy</code>.  This means that instead of
an HTTP 200 with 25k of content proxied from the Jetty instance, the
spammer sees an HTTP 403 with 300 bytes of content and the Jetty
instance is none the wiser.</p>

<p>If you're going to do this yourself, the two tools that I found
most useful were the standard Apache <a
href="http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">reference</a>
and Ralf Engelschall's <a
href="http://www.engelschall.com/pw/apache/rewriteguide/">guide</a>
that includes a number of <code>mod_rewrite</code> recipes.  (Tom
Moertel's Perl <a
href="http://community.moertel.com/ss/space/2004-03-18">recipe</a> is
worth a look, too.)</p>
