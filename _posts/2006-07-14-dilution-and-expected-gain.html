<p>I always referred to shareholders as &#8220;investors&#8221;, but that can give someone the illusion that the private company securities that they hold are in some way similar to publicly-traded securities &#8212; which they are not.  Unlike publicly-traded securities, shares of a private company are converted to cash on exit and only on exit, so a shareholder should favor activities that promote exit <em>and</em> enhance value.</p>

<p>Ideally, then, current shareholders would welcome a new round of funding.  Dilution will occur, but if things work properly, then the combination of owning a smaller portion of a more valuable entity works out in the shareholders' favor.  Even if the value computation is slightly unfavorable, if the investment would enhance the expected gain, i.e., the value weighted by the probability of an exit.  If new capital comes with changes of control structure, liquidation preferences, registration rights, participation rights, etc., that all contributes to the expected gain computation.  This is especially true if the business needs the capital, in which case the expected gain computation can be reduced to the simple question &#8220;Is expected value non-zero without the money?&#8221;  &#8220;Need&#8221; is a strong word, and a need for capital <em>never</em> arises instantaneously.  It is up to the Board and the shareholders (to a much lesser extent) to demand creativity and stewardship of capital from the management team on an ongoing basis and not just when the needle hits &#8220;E&#8221;.</p>
