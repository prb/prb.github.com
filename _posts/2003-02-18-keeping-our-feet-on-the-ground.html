<p>Phil Wainwright had some nice quips in "<a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/2003_02_09_lc.htm#90312538">Boom to bust and back again</a>" on the <a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/">LooselyCoupled.com</a> <a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog">blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>It's not a market, it's a mechanism: "There is no natural
market for the technology alone."</blockquote>

<p>It takes a visionary technical manager to connect the possibilities of a technology with the needs of a business, and the coincidence of real vision, business need, and budget is too rare to build a business on.</p>

<p>The art of selling technology is eliciting (or having advance knowledge of) a customer's business needs and then choosing the right technology. Both technology vendors and customers would be better off if customers made fewer a priori technology decisions and vendors asked more questions.</p>

<blockquote>It's not a quick fix for problem software: "Using it to
plaster over structural problems in older software may seem to work
for a while, but it just defers the day of reckoning."</blockquote>

<p>I'll take a plunge and comment before I read Phil's article.  Bad
software is bad software, and wrappering won't improve it under any
circumstances.  Nonetheless, I see wrappering old or bad software in
asynchronous web services - i.e., loose coupling - as a mechanism for
improving the overall reliability of composite applications. (A very
reasonable example would be wrapping a .NET webservice around the
Microsoft Word object instead of getting at it through JNI or through
VBScript with BSF.)</p>

<blockquote>"Don't trust anything you hear from the big vendors: "IBM,
Microsoft, Sun and the others &hellip; are fighting a desperate battle
to defend their existing market positions in the face of hugely
unpredictable and disruptive forces for change."</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure that small vendors are exactly trustworthy, either, but at least they're also not capable of steamrolling customers with marketing.</p>

<p>My sincere hope is that some of the genuinely good ideas in web services and service-oriented architecture don't get lost somewhere in the salvos of hype and anti-hype.</p>
