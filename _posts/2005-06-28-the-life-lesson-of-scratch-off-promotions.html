<p>It's all too easy to start a company (or other endeavor) with "This idea is going to make me rich" as both motivation and success criterion, and it's possible to have that measuring stick rob you of all joy during the journey or lead you to make inappropriate decisions.  I'd like to propose the promotional scratch-off -- the kind of gamepiece you get when you buy a fast food meal during a movie tie-in or something similar -- as a life lesson.  (Life lessons for the price of a burger and coke are definitely among the most inexpensive available...)</p>

<p>You pay a fair price for a burger, and the gamepiece rides along as a bonus.  Maybe you win fries, maybe a burger, maybe nothing...  Even if you do win through persistence, eating burgers to win a prize is only going to make you <a href="http://www.supersizeme.com/">fat</a>.</p>
