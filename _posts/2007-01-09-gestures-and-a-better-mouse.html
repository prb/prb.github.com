<p>In spite of it being relatively expensive, I might just get an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a>, and it's the gesture-based UI that has me interested rather than any of the other gee-whiz stuff, which I view as incremental.  (I don't have time or interest to watch video at home, and the last thing I want is to clutter my head with more noise when I have moments of inactivity.)</p>

<p>When I got a fingertip <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2003/05/12/temporary-disability">smashed</a> by a faulty window way back when we moved into a new condo in Chicago (fully recovered), <a href="http://www.crazybob.org/">Bob</a> gifted me me with a <a href="http://www.fingerworks.com/ST_product.html">FingerWorks</a> keyboard that he'd been playing with.  It was a bit of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant">white elephant</a> in that it reduced my typing to a crawl and some common IDE key combinations (e.g., CTRL-[SPACE]) were difficult), but the <a href="http://www.fingerworks.com/touchstream_gesture_guide.html">gestures</a> were the first interesting user experience that I've had since I first tried a mouse.  Different numbers of fingers were used for clicking, selecting, dragging, scrolling; closing the current window was like screwing the lid on a jar with three fingers, and opening a file was like unscrewing it.  Ultimately, the novelty of the gestures didn't outweigh input speed, and the keyboard now sits in my closet.  (Not for sale; the only thing I'd do with it would be to reluctantly give it back to Bob if he asked.)</p>

<p>I didn't have the foresight to pick up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fingerworks-IGESTURENUMPAD-iGesture-Pad/dp/B00013MVT4">standalone gesture pad</a>, and even somewhat broken ones are <a href="http://www.ergoamerica.com/pad.html">going for</a> almost $100.  (I haven't seen a non-broken one recently.)  Hopefully the iPhone will be successful and someone will provide a gesture-based input device for the desktop, and I'll gladly be a customer &#8212; build a better mouse, and I'll beat a path to your website.</p>
