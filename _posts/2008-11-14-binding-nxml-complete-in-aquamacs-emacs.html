<p>The folks who bundled up <a
href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/nxml-mode/">nXML mode</a> for
inclusion with <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs Emacs</a> did
think to include the useful schemas bundled with nXML&#160;mode, e.g., for
XSLT 1.0, but I can't figure out why they didn't bind
<code>nxml-complete</code> (context-sensitive, schema-driven
completion and suggestion) to a keystroke.  (If memory serves, <code>C-Return</code> used to work.)</p>

<p>It's an easy fix, but I always forget just how to do it.  As a
reminder to myself or a hint to others, the fix is to add the
following to
<code>~/Library/Preferences/Aquamacs&#160;Emacs/</code>:</p>

<pre class="code">(add-hook 'nxml-mode-hook
	  '(lambda ()
	     (define-key nxml-mode-map "\C-c\C-c"
	       'nxml-complete)))</pre>

<p>My preference is for <code>C-c C-c</code> but yours may be
different.  In any case, that's about as blissful as editing XSLT
gets.</p>
