<p>The kid's not old enough yet if you believe what the boxes say, but we've gone ahead and gotten her some <a href="http://www.brio.net/BRIO_NET/corporate/Startpage.htm">Brio</a> trains to play with.  (For what it's worth, we went with Brio over <a href="http://www.tomy.co.uk/products/favourite-products/thomas-friends/">Thomas</a> as an extension of our "no Disney" rule &#8212; in a nutshell, anthropomorphized things derived from TV shows or movies are bad.  The kid loves the trains (although she does wonder why some have eyes and hers don't) and runs them around and around whatever track we have set up on her play table yelling "choo choo".  (I'll wait until she's older to tell her that "choo choo" is a bit of an anachronism, e.g., when she's old enough to know what anachronism means.)</p>

<p>Anyway, when we first set up the train set, the kid was rough enough that any elevated track tended to fall down.  Gluing the tracks together or nailing them down didn't make sense, but the wife came up with the idea of using masking tape on the underside of the joints in the track.  It works like a charm; the track stays together when the kid is using it, but it's easy to take the tape off and lay out a new configuration.  Now we just have to get down off of our anthropomorphism horse to figure out how to get a dispenser with eyes, and we can market Rufus, the Very Useful Track Tape&trade;...</p>
