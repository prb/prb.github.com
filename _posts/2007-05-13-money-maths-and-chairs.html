<p>I took advantage of being in the Bay Area for JavaOne and went to visit my Ph.D. advisor over in Berkeley.  After breakfast, he gave me a tour of the renovated and expanded Mathematical Sciences Research Institute ("MSRI", pronounced "misery" in the old days) up the hill.  Since the last time that I'd been there (probably 2000 or 2001), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harris_Simons">Jim Simons</a>, among others, stepped up and led a funding drive for MSRI that expanded and renovated the institute.  The differences from my time in graduate school a decade ago were striking, but I can sum it up in two pictures:</p>

<p>The shot on the left is what I remember the auditorium seating looking like, and the shot on the right is what it is now.  The old seating had the distinct advantage of being uncomfortable, ergo difficult to doze off in, even if a talk was particularly boring.</p>
