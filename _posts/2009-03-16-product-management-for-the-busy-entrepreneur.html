<p>I was talking with a budding entrepreneur in the open source "big
data" space (with my <a
href="http://entreprementor.com">Entreprementor</a> hat on), and we
talked about his sales pipeline and potential customers.  He had a
list of a couple dozen companies that had expressed some interest, and
that much was great.  Just the same, I asked about the elephant in the
room: Interest in <em>what</em>?  Interest in your wonderful open
source doohickey might get you Internet Famous like the <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPPj6viIBmU">Star Wars Kid</a>
but isn't likely to pay your bills let alone be something to build a
company on.</p>

<p>This brings me to the subject of product management for
the busy entrepreneur.</p>

<h2>Product Versus Business</h2>

<p>It's easy to get confused about the difference between a
<em>product</em> and a <em>business</em>.  A <em>business</em> is a
machine that turns something you have into money.  (One that produces
more money than it consumes is a <em>good</em> business...)  A
<em>product</em> is a describable, sellable thing that your business
can produce over and over and customers can consume over and over
without too many changes.  Products can be broad, like professional
services, or very specific, like machine parts, but the aspects of
commonality in description and delivery need to be there.</p>

<p>The point of a product is that the commonalities enable scale in a
business's internal processes, from production to sales to accounting.
It is also that commonality that makes a business an investment
prospect because you can make reasonable inferences about capital in
versus capital out (ergo value).  Defining a product involves a bit of
intuition and guesswork, but refining that definition is simple: Ask
potential customers if they would spend money on it.  I've never been
able to understand the relative reluctance of some entrepreneurs to
get on the phone or hit the street with an idea, maybe out of a
reluctance to have their idea trashed by reality, but the customer's
money is the one source of Truth.  If it's difficult to explain, if
it's not something that the customer's business can readily consume,
or if the customer doesn't "get" it, then it needs to change.</p>

<h2>Rows and Columns</h2>

<p>Once you have a panel of potential customers assembled, it's time
to sit down with a spreadsheet and figure things out.  Customers go
down column "A", and potential products go across row 1.  Put an "x"
and maybe a note in a cell if that customer would pay for that
product, and then look for the column with the most x's.
Alternatively, you can use the price that the customer would pay as
the value for the cell in the column and try to make a more refined
decision based on the profitability of the offerings, but the idea is
the same &#8212; Get real data on what customers want.</p>

<p>There's an aspect to survey design that's important when
interviewing a potential customer.  To get a real response, ask
specific questions and set the expectation with that potential
customer that you'll very likely be back to get a check from them.
You should expect to iterate on the process a few times, as customers
may help you add columns to the spreadsheet, but you should avoid
open-ended questions.</p>

<p>Real product management is quite a bit more involved and detailed
but equally necessary as your product and base of customers grows and
evolves.  Nonetheless, this should be enough to get started.</p>

<p>Basic product management is one of those times where stating the
obvious is useful: <em>Data is helpful in making decisions.</em></p>
