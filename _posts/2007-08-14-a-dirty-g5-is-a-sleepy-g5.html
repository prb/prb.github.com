<p>I use a venerable G5 quad for most of my work at home, and other than being noisy and producing a lot of heat, it's been a good machine.  Then last night, after I tweaked some of the base options (with <tt>/usr/sbin/sysctl</tt>) to get more processes per user, it started going to sleep at random times.  A look in the system log showed:</p>

<p>Ah.  CPU B is too hot...</p>

<p>I popped the side panel off, pulled the air deflector and fans, cleaned a bunch of dust off of the air filter for the CPU module, put things back together, and all is well &#8212; and quieter.</p>
