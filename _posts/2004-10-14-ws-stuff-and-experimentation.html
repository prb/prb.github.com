<p>The important thing for people to realize is that both individually and collectively, the WS-* specifications are a work in progress.  Wwork is ongoing by vendors, by end-users, by thought leaders, to figure out what is important (i.e., useful) through a mixture of implementation and experimentation.</p>

<p>A new specification should be looked at as a proposed experiment.  The experiment should be based on a set of well-considered hypotheses and motivated by practical experiences.  The history of the accepted standards in the space (e.g., the evolution of SOAP from the initial proposal to the refinements outlined by the WS-I Basic Profile) bears this out, and other experiments (e.g., BPEL4WS 1.1 becoming WS-BPEL 2.0) are being tempered by implementers and collective discussion.  The questions in my mind are not so much about establishing the fundamental and forever immutable tenets of Web Services &#8212; always an impossible task for <em>any</em> effort &#8212; but rather about ensuring that the experiments that we are investing in are properly conceived, controlled, and executed.</p>
