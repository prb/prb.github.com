<p>Multifarious has been running comfortably and profitably for the
past couple of years with just me and the occasional subcontractor,
but it's time to grow the business: I'm looking for an <a
href="http://mult.ifario.us/corp/jobs/sw_eng.html">engineer</a> to
come and work for me full-time.</p>

<p>The basic "win" for the position is obvious &#8212; great pay, great
environment, challenging work &#8212; but the bigger picture should be
compelling as well.  As I described <a
href="http://blog.prb.io/up-to-what-i-am.html">last year</a>,
Multifarious is intended to be a springboard for an ongoing series of
business experiments, and this is a place where the right candidate
can gain knowledge and experience that they wouldn't otherwise have
access to in a purely engineering context.</p>
