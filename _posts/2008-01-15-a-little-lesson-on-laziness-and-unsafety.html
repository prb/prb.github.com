<p>I learned a good lesson about Haskell and unsafe IO today.</p>

<p>As I added comment support to <a
href="http://datapr0n.com/perpubplat">perpubplat</a>, I did a little
performance testing on comment submission just to make sure that it
would behave decently, and I started picking up sporadic segmentation
faults under load with no discernible pattern.  The faults were
occurring as the new comment was serialized to disk, which to the
imperative programmer's eye, seems impossible, since the code that
does the writing is plain vanilla Haskell code:</p>

<pre class="code">write_ :: B.Item -> IO ()
write_ i = do { let f = filename (B.internal_id i)
              ; h &lt;- openFile f WriteMode
              ; hPutStr h $ B.to_string i
              ; hClose h }</pre>

<p>On <a
href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/IRC_channel"><code>#haskell</code></a>,
<code>dcoutts</code> made the helpful suggestion to check for any
foreign code, and thereby hangs a tale.  (The GHC documentation <a
href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/users_guide/wrong-compilee.html">makes</a>
the same suggestion.)  Laziness means that computations may not be
performed before their results are needed, so it's not enough to think
about what's happening in the <code>write_</code> function; you also
have to think about the computation that created the value that's
passed to <code>write_</code>, and on and on.  With enough
back-tracing, the data passed to <code>write_</code> had its roots in
fields read from an HTTP request handled by FastCGI, and the root
cause was buried in the implementation of the function that reads the
form fields: a <code>ByteString</code> being built out of a hunk of
memory allocated to a FastCGI structure
using... <code>unsafeInterleaveIO</code>.  The segmentation fault was
occurring when the evaluation of the <code>write_</code> function (on a
background thread) was effectively trying to read that hunk of memory
that had been freed back when request processing was completed.</p>

<p>Copying the data in the request handling resolved the issue, but
the FastCGI library should probably change slightly to insulate its
clients from this issue.</p>
