<p>WS-BPEL is <em>finally</em> in public review.  John Evdemon has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon/archive/2006/09/11/749753.aspx">links and additional information</a> on his <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jevdemon">blog</a>.</p>

<p>Every time I talked with Maciej about what was happening and created a mental estimate of when the WS-BPEL spec would finally be out, I added a twelve-month buffer, just in case.  Even then, my guesses were always early.  Nonetheless, as an educated observer, I think that the process took about the right amount of time.</p>
