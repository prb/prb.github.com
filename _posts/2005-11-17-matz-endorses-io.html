<p>This is old news at this point, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto">Matz</a> endorsed <a href="http://www.iolanguage.com">Io</a> in a roundtable (transcribed by <a href="http://jroller.com/comments/obie/Weblog/matz_roundtable_notes">Obie Fernandez</a> and the good people at <a href="http://topfunky.com/clients/rails/matz_roundtable.txt">TopFunky</a>):</p>

<blockquote><b>interviewer:</b> For those that adhere to learn one new language per year which other languages should we learn?</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Matz:</b> (<i>paraphrased</i>) I recommend the io language. It's an object oriented, the prototype is, and everything is a method call, even the assignments, and the declarations, and the method definition. Everything is a message. So it's kind of a simple and interesting language.</blockquote>

<p>I'm already a <a href="http://mult.ifario.us/articles/2004/04/02/a-little-fun-with-concurrency-in-io">fan</a> of Io because of some of its langauge features (prototypes, futures) and the emphasis on messaging, but hopefully this endorsement gets the language some additional visibility and use as it approaches a <a href="http://www.iolanguage.com/blog/blog.cgi?do=item&amp;id=54">1.0 release</a>.</p>
