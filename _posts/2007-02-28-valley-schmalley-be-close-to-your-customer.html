<p>I ran across <a href="http://www.participatemedia.com/?page_id=20">Alan Warms</a>'s <a href="http://www.participatemedia.com/?p=77">response</a> to a <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2007/02/startupping_lau.html">question</a> from <a href="http://ross.typepad.com/">Ross Mayfield</a> to <a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/askthewizard/">Dick Costolo</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>How does an Internet entrepreneur overcome not being in the Silicon Valley?</p></blockquote>

<p>(Dick, by the way, has been publishing lots of good stuff on his <a href="http://www.burningdoor.com/askthewizard/">Ask the Wizard</a> blog.)  The answer is: it depends on how far you are from your customer.</p>

<p>Before moving West to wetter pastures, I lived in Chicago for 8 years, five of which I spent as an entrepreneur, and Chicago is a great place to build a <em>business</em>.  My experience matches Alan's:</p>

<li>You can make a late morning meeting anywhere in the country &#8212; other than the East Coast &#8212; without staying overnight.  For the East Coast (e.g., NY, Boston, Atlanta), early afternoon works better, and you can still be home for a late dinner.  Chicago is a hub for United and Southwest, and commuting to major cities in the Midwest (like Nashville, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Detroit, and Milwaukee) is as convenient as commuting to the Chicago suburbs.  (Unfortunately, that doesn't say all that much...)</li>
<li>There are plenty of smart young people around.  Within Chicago or close-in suburbs, there are: <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern</a>, and <a href="http://www.uic.edu">University of Illinois Chicago</a>.  Within a reasonable distance, there are <a href="http://www.uiuc.edu">University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</a>, <a href="http://www.purdue.edu">Purdue</a>, <a href="http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>,...</li>
<li>There are plenty of experienced industry practitioners in the area, thanks to the shippers/haulers, banks, financial services companies, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare companies, insurance companies, manufacturers, heavy industries, and other companies in the <em>immediate</em> area.  The first few that come to mind are Motorola, State Farm, Citadel, Allstate, Baxter Healthcare, Caterpillar, UBS, McDonalds, BankOne, Wrigley, and Boeing.  If you cast a slightly wider net, say a ninety-minute plane flight, you pick up Harley Davidson, GM, Ford, Chrysler, Schneider National, Anheuser-Busch, Smurfit-Stone, AG Edwards, and Northwestern Mutual.</li>
<li>Corporate necessities are affordable.  For example, we rented industrial loft space for $10 per square foot (per year).  During the Bubble.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're looking to raise venture capital, there are some top-shelf people in Chicago.  (Based on personal experience, I have good things to say about <a href="http://www.apexvc.com">Apex</a>, <a href="http://www.jkbcapital.com/">JK&amp;B</a>, and <a href="http://www.ocaventures.com/">OCA</a>.)  Valley VCs may be reluctant to sign up for years of plane flights for Board meetings when they have plenty of action close to home, and I can't really blame them for that.</p>

<p>For the first four years of its life, FiveSight sold traditionally-licensed middleware to end-users (like those companies that I listed above), and all of the advantages that I've just enumerated worked in our favor.  As our model shifted to one where our customers, partners, and potential acquirers were software companies, not being in the Valley left us at a disadvantage competing with companies that had a presence there.  Flying out to get customer face-time became both a necessity and a distraction for the core team both because of the travel time and because of the temporary loss of the close communication and collaboration that made the team work best.  I can recall one acquisition opportunity where our competitor could literally <em>walk</em> to the offices of the acquirer.  Even in the most objective head-to-head competition, the local candidate is going to be able to more effectively gather and apply information to influence the deal.  Also, being unknown is a disadvantage.  The environment in the Valley doesn't actively <em>exclude</em> outsiders, but it tends to <em>include</em> insiders via "X worked with Y at company Z funded by W" relationships.</p>

<p>(This reminds me that I need to write an entry about when to go "all in".)</p>

<p>Open source, blogging, and professional/social use of the Internet are helping information to travel faster and farther than it did previously, but these things only make a difference when they bring you into closer and better communication with your customer.</p>
