<p>The fundamental goal of selling is to clearly communicate to your
audience, and this applies equally to pitching a company to investors
or pitching a product to potential customers.  It's obvious that
confusing the audience conflicts with that fundamental goal, but it
can be surprisingly difficult to avoid.</p>

<p>Your goal should be to provide your audience with <em>exactly</em>
the information they need to make a decision, no more and no less.
It's easy enough to fix providing too little information &#8212; just
provide more.  Providing too much information, probably confusing your
audience in the process, is much more difficult to cure, and this is
where a lesson from chess club comes in.</p>

alt="Chess Clock by " width="100" height="100" /></a> Keeping the
feedback loop tight is the best way to throttle the flow of
information, and using a chess clock &#8212; imagined or actual
&#8212; is one way to do that.  When you start talking, think about
tapping the clock to start your turn, or if you're on the phone or
otherwise not in front of the customer, feel free to use a stopwatch
or countdown timer.  Twenty to thirty seconds is a reasonable
benchmark, and if you've got other people in on the pitch with you,
it's up to you to set the ground rules for them to ensure that
everyone's bound by the clock.  It's enough time to communicate an
idea but not so much time that your audience starts reaching for their
Blackberries while you ramble.</p>
