href="http://netzooid.com/blog/">Dan Diephouse</a>, I'll be <a
href="http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2009/public/schedule/detail/8362">speaking</a>
at OSCON on July&#160;23.</p>

<p>Taking the abstract literally, the talk looks like it is about
building a Twitter clone with open source components, but it is not at
all intended to be armchair quarterbacking about Twitter's early
problems with availability.  (We should all have these problems!)
Rather, the talk is intended to be about some of the current crop of
interesting open source distributed storage technologies &#8212; <a
href="http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/">Cassandra</a>, <a
href="http://project-voldemort.com/">Voldemort</a>, <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/">Redis</a> (where the folks have
already done some <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/wiki/TwitterAlikeExample">thinking</a>
about Twitter-like apps), <a
href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>, <a
href="http://hadoop.apache.org/hbase/">HBase</a>, <a
href="http://github.com/cliffmoon/dynomite">Dynomite</a> &#8212; as
well as how to attack some of the operational problems (e.g.,
deployment, instrumentation, application updates) that come with using
new tools in multi-node environments.</p>

<p>That's obviously quite a bit to fit into a relatively short
speaking slot, but Dan and I plan to blog or otherwise publish
material that won't fit.</p>
